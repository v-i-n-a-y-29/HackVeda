Fisheries refer to the harvesting of fish and other aquatic organisms from oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes for food, livelihoods, and economic activity.

Climate change affects fisheries through rising ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, sea level rise, and changes in ocean circulation. These changes alter fish distribution, spawning patterns, growth rates, and survival.

Warmer waters cause many fish species to migrate toward cooler regions, leading to shifts in regional fish availability and biodiversity loss in tropical areas. Ocean acidification reduces the ability of shell-forming species to survive, impacting marine food chains.

Sustainable fisheries management is essential to maintain fish populations, protect ecosystems, and ensure food security for future generations.
