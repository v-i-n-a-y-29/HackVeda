Overfishing occurs when fish populations are harvested at a rate faster than they can naturally reproduce.

Overfishing leads to depleted fish stocks, reduced biodiversity, and disruption of marine ecosystems. It also threatens food security and the livelihoods of coastal communities.

Common causes of overfishing include excessive fishing capacity, illegal and unregulated fishing, weak enforcement of regulations, and high global demand for seafood.

Effective solutions include catch limits, seasonal bans, marine protected areas, and international fisheries agreements to promote sustainable fishing practices.
