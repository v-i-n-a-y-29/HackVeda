Abstract


Climate variability and change are affecting hydro-meteorological cycles and altering
aquatic ecosystems, driving shifts in physical and chemical processes, ecological
communities and the distribution and abundance of species. These changes have
implications for fisheries management, food security and the livelihoods of more than
600 million people worldwide that are employed in fisheries and aquaculture, their value
chains and related industries.
    This conference, FishAdapt: the global conference on climate change adaptation for
fisheries and aquaculture, held in Bangkok from 8 to 10 August, 2016, provided a forum
for scientists, development professionals and natural resource managers working in the
context of fisheries, aquaculture, rural development and related fields to share practical
experiences in understanding the vulnerabilities associated with climate change and ocean
acidification and the development of risk management and adaptation strategies. The
conference bridged interdisciplinary gaps and provide a wider, shared perspective on the
issues and the current state of knowledge. These proceedings share the experiences of the
110 participants from 27 countries and show that much can be done at the household,
community and sector levels to support the resilience of the sector and its dependent
communities in a changing climate.

The FishAdapt conference 2016


CONVENOR’S MESSAGE
Dr Cherdsak Virapat, Director General, Network of Aquaculture Centres in
Asia-Pacific

On behalf of the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA), I am
pleased that NACA could co-organize the FishAdapt Conference in collaboration
with the Thailand Department of Fisheries, FAO, the Global Partnership for Climate,
Fisheries and Aquaculture, and relevant partner organizations in Bangkok, Kingdom
of Thailand. I would like to quote Mr Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary General, who
stated:
      Climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution... It requires urgent
      efforts on the part of every country, every citizen, every business community and civil
      society… The severity of cyclones, floods and other consequences of climate change are
      increasing. Strong disaster risk reduction and adaptation policies will be increasingly
      essential.

INTRODUCTION TO THE CONFERENCE
Climate change – as defined by the IPCC as a change in the state of the climate that
can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties,
and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer (IPCC, 2014)1
- is altering aquatic ecosystems, driving shifts in physical and chemical processes,
ecological communities and the distribution and abundance of species. These changes
have implications for fisheries management, food security and the livelihoods of the
millions of people worldwide that are employed in fisheries and aquaculture or related
industries.
    Worldwide, over 600 million people depend directly or indirectly on fisheries and
aquaculture for their livelihoods. Fish provides essential nutrition for over 4 billion
people and at least 50 percent of animal protein and essential minerals to 400 million
people in the poorest countries. Trade in fish and fisheries products is also important
for societies and economies: fish products are among the most widely traded foods,
with more than 37 percent by volume of world production traded internationally. Yet,
the fisheries and aquaculture sectors are facing many issues, such as overfishing, habitat
degradation and pollution, and climate change and variability have the potential to
compound existing pressures on the sector, but can also provide opportunities.
    Climate variability and change is already affecting aquatic systems’ physical,
chemical and biological processes, potentially resulting in changes in fish life cycles,
habitats, species compositions, distributions or abundance, which can impact fisheries
management, livelihoods, food security and sustainable development. Sea level rise and
extreme climate events can also have direct impacts on fishing operations and safety at
sea, as well as on the physical infrastructure of coastal communities and communities
along rivers and lakes destroying or severely damaging assets such as boats, landing
sites, post-harvesting facilities and roads. Displacement of populations because of
high-dam construction is also an issue. There may also be positive opportunities in

            fisheries associated with locally improved ecosystem and productivity conditions
            and in aquaculture with sea level rise and expansion opportunities in salinized coastal
            margins, or with better temperature conditions for local stocks. Finally, although ocean
            acidification is not strictly related to climate change, its impacts are often discussed
            alongside climate change impacts because it is also linked to increasing CO2 and
            may have feedback links to climate change. Thus, in this document some adaptation
            strategies to ocean acidification are also discussed through case studies.
               In economies dependent on fisheries and aquaculture, coastal communities, fishers
            and fish farmers are expected to experience the direct effects of climate change in
            a variety of ways, such as increased risks of human diseases (for example, malaria
            and cholera) relating to increased temperatures and displacement and migration of
            human populations from low-lying areas to less risky areas or to follow changes
            in fish distribution. One must note that many fishing communities (both inland
            and marine) and coastal communities already subsist in precarious and vulnerable
            conditions because of poverty and rural underdevelopment, with their well-being often
            undermined by overexploitation of fishery resources, degraded ecosystems and water
            scarcity. Communities dependent on fisheries and aquaculture often lack the ability to
            anticipate and adapt to climate change and variability and hence they tend to be among
            the most vulnerable. Climate variability and change can exacerbate food insecurity in
            areas currently vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition.

            Climate change adaptation of fisheries and aquaculture
            Much can be done at the household, community and sector levels to support the
            resilience of the sector in a changing climate. For example, communities dependent
            on fisheries and aquaculture can receive targeted and improved weather and extreme
            event information, which can help ensure the safety of fishing vessels and fishers while
            out fishing. The sector can also be supported to improve its monitoring and analysis
            of local changes and to have access to global information. Other adaptation options
            include social protection and livelihood diversification as well as support to exit from
            the sector if necessary. Methods and zones of fishing and fish-farming can be adapted
            to the change that is likely to occur and post-harvest processes can be improved to
            adjust to changing species and to minimize losses caused by temperature-related
            spoilage and disease risks. The adaptive capacity of the aquatic ecosystems can also
            be improved, such as through implementing the ecosystem approach to fisheries and
            aquaculture (EAFA), using natural defenses to erosion and storms and minimizing
            the negative impacts of harmful fishing and farming activities to support the general
            resilience of the ecosystems supporting the sector.
                Fisheries and aquaculture systems and communities can also be provided with
            important enabling environments, such as through secure tenure and access rights
            to the natural resources upon which they depend. Policymakers and managers can
            implement adaptive fisheries co-management plans, legislate vulnerability assessments
            within the sector and ensure that management, development and trade strategies and
            policies are climate and disaster-proofed. It is also essential to ensure that the needs of
            the sector are included in broader national and regional climate change discussions and
            that adaptation and mitigation measures in one sector do not negatively affect food
            security and livelihoods in other sectors, such as fisheries, through reduced water flows
            or hard irrigation infrastructure impacting aquatic habitats.
                This conference, FishAdapt: Global conference on climate change adaptation for
            fisheries and aquaculture (hereafter referred to as the FishAdapt Conference), targeted
            a wide range of professionals working in the context of fisheries, aquaculture, rural
            development and related fields. It provided a forum to share practical experiences in
            understanding the vulnerabilities associated with climate change and the development
            of risk management and adaptation strategies. The conference aimed to bridge

interdisciplinary gaps and provide a wider, shared perspective on the issues and the
current state of knowledge.

CONFERENCE OBJECTIVES
This FishAdapt Conference provided participants the opportunity to share their
practical experiences in understanding vulnerabilities associated with climate change and
in identifying, prioritizing and implementing adaptation and disaster risk management
actions within the fisheries and aquaculture sector and dependent communities. The
objectives of the global conference were to:
   1. provide countries, fisheries and aquaculture institutions and networks, civil
      society, private sector, development partners, and academic institutions the
      opportunity to present their work in fisheries and aquaculture climate change
      adaptation and disaster risk management;
   1. foster the exchange of information and experiences from case studies and projects
      that aim to show how climate change adaptation in fisheries and aquaculture and
      disaster risk management may be implemented in different regional and ecosystem
      settings among fishers, farmers, value chains and dependent communities;
   2. disseminate the wealth of experiences shared through the conference proceedings,
      which will include selected conferences papers;
   3. support the development of policy briefs based on input from the conference
      to inform policymakers on best practices on climate change adaptation and risk
      management; and
   4. increase awareness of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
      Change (UNFCCC) processes and inform on how efforts may be communicated
      to the UNFCCC through, for example, the Nairobi Work Plan, the UNFCCC
      Least Developed Countries Expert Group and the UNFCCC Adaptation
      Committee activities.

CONFERENCE THEMES
The Conference included a series of presentations in plenary sessions and four
special sessions, with panels and discussion time. The 110 participants (see Annex 2)
exchanged experiences and created ideas and best practices on which to act to assist the
sector in furthering its efforts to reduce vulnerability and improve resilience to climate
variability and change. The final, full conference programme is available in Annex 3.

The conference schedule included 45 presentations in plenary sessions covering four
areas:
1. Applied risk/vulnerability assessments in fisheries and aquaculture.
   This theme addressed understanding vulnerability of fisheries and aquaculture
   and their dependent communities to climate change and variability along the value
   chain.

2. Climate change adaptation efforts in fisheries and aquaculture.
   This theme addressed identifying, prioritizing, negotiating, implementing, and
   monitoring adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability and to realize opportunities
   in fisheries and aquaculture now and in the future.

   The scope of adaptation actions could include:
   i. different scales (from individuals, to communities, sectors, regions and beyond);
   ii. ecological, social, economic, institutional, governance, technological and
        operational or informational aspects of adaptation;
   iii. climate variability versus long-term climate change;
   iv. extreme climate events or slow onset events;
4   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




               v. reducing vulnerability to specific climate drivers or vulnerability contexts;
               vi. different portions of the value chain (production/harvest, post-harvest and
                     trade);
               vii. different ecosystems (such as tropical and temperate) in marine, coastal and
                     inland areas — the latter include lakes, reservoirs, rivers and wetlands; and
               viii. different sub-sectors — commercial, subsistence, aquaculture, and recreational
                     fisheries.

            3. Linking fisheries and aquaculture adaptation to broader processes.
               This theme addressed issues related to:
               a. representing the sector and value chains in national, regional and global climate
                  change adaptation planning processes;
               b. managing synergies and trade-offs between climate change adaptation and
                  greenhouse gas mitigation action in other sectors; and
               c. accessing climate funding for improving resilience.

            4. Communicating climate change issues and potential impacts.
               Targets of communication included policymakers, fishers, farmers, fish workers,
               scientists, development partners, industry and others for effective planning,
               implementation, and monitoring.

               In addition to the plenary sessions, four parallel sessions were scheduled on Day 3:
               • Climate change in small-scale fisheries: vulnerability, adaptive capacity and
                 response.
               • Integrating gender considerations into climate change and disaster risk reduction
                 strategies for fishing communities.
               • Charting a course after Paris: leveraging nationally determined contributions
                 (NDCs) to reduce greenhouse gases, which were at the heart of the Paris
                 Agreement, to address climate challenges for fisheries and aquaculture in the
                 Asia-Pacific region.
               • Mangrove-based fisheries and aquaculture in support of climate change adaptation.

Report of the conference

OPENING OF THE CONFERENCE
Dr Chonkolnee Chamchang, Senior Expert on International Fisheries Affairs
opened the conference on behalf of the Director General of the Department of
Fisheries, Kingdom of Thailand:
   It gives me great honour and pleasure to welcome you to this global conference on
climate change adaptation for fisheries and aquaculture. This is considered a historic
gathering of the global experts on climate change relevant to fisheries and aquaculture.
   The FAO’s State of the World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2014 reported capture
fisheries production of 91 million tonnes and aquaculture production of 67 million
tonnes giving a total of 158 million tonnes. Aquaculture production alone was valued
at USD 137.7 billion. The Asia-Pacific region accounts for 88 percent of global
aquaculture production.
   The Asia-Pacific region is the most vulnerable to natural disasters with up to
70 percent of the disasters occurring in Asia and two-thirds of the victims. Water
resources in Asia-Pacific, which are a key to food security, are affected by poor water
quality — only 15 percent to 20 percent of wastewater receives some level of treatment
before being discharged into water resources. The remainder is discharged with its full
load of pollutants and toxic compounds. More than 4.2 billion people live in the Asia-
Pacific region constituting 60 percent of the world population.
   The Mekong River Commission stated that climate change is no longer just a threat
in the Lower Mekong Basin. Its impact is present and is affecting the livelihoods of
millions that rely on the river’s natural resources. Changes in temperature, rainfall,
river flow and flooding as a result of climate change affect agricultural and fisheries
and, as a result, reduce food security, especially for the poor. Additionally, a predicted
rise in sea level will increase salinity and floods in the Mekong Delta, causing damage
to crops in the most productive area of the basin.
   Today the world is already facing numerous political and economic crises and now
with the impacts of climate change it will be even more difficult to achieve sustainable
fisheries and aquaculture goals to increase fish production as food for human
consumption to meet the needs of the growing world population.
   I hope that the conference will provide a great opportunity for us to share ideas and
experiences and recommend appropriate policy guidance, means and implementation
for future activities concerning vulnerability assessment and adaptation to the impacts
of climate change and related incidents.

Ms Xiangjun Yao, Regional Initiative Coordinator for Asia and the Pacific
welcomed delegates on behalf of Ms Kundhavi Kadiresan, Assistant Director-General,
FAO Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific:
   It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the first global conference on climate change
adaptation for fisheries and aquaculture, which promises to be an exciting three days
of learning, discussions, sharing, and networking.
   The build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is changing the oceans,
coasts and freshwater ecosystems. This is severely compromising the fisheries and
aquaculture sector’s ability to deliver food for current and future generations and to
support the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement of The
Twenty-first Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We must remember that fisheries and
6   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




            aquaculture are vital sources of nutritious food and protein for over four billion people
            and provide at least 50 percent of animal protein to 400 million people in the poorest
            countries, including small island developing states (SIDS). Fisheries and aquaculture
            also support the livelihoods of 10 to 12 percent of the global population, including
            many vulnerable fishing and fish-farming communities.
                Preliminary data on increasing ocean water temperatures imply changes in
            distribution and production cycles of both freshwater and marine species, with the
            ranges of most marine species being driven toward the higher latitudes. This migration
            of commercial species will result in winners and losers, leaving serious deficits in
            tropical countries where marine fish availability is predicted to decrease by as much
            as 40 percent. This will have cascading effects on economic growth and jobs along the
            seafood value chain.
                Greenhouse gas accumulation is also increasing the acidification of oceans, with
            particularly severe consequences for shellfish and squid, mangroves, tropical coral reefs
            and cold water corals. Coral reefs provide habitats for one out of four marine species
            and provide almost USD 6 billion/year in benefits through fisheries alone. However,
            rising temperatures and the recent El Niño event are putting the world’s corals at great
            risk of coral bleaching.
                Because of their location and type of livelihoods, fishers, fish farmers and coastal
            communities are physically at risk of natural hazards exacerbated by climate change, such
            as toxic algal blooms, floods, strong wave surges and cyclones that destroy infrastructure
            and make the act of fishing more dangerous, especially for artisanal fishers in small boats.
                SIDS — which depend on fisheries and aquaculture for at least 50 percent of their
            animal protein intake — are in a particularly vulnerable position with respect to
            natural hazards and changes in availability of fish. In addition, sea level rise could lead
            to smaller exclusive economic zones (EEZs) as coastlines shrink, which would reduce
            SIDS’ national jurisdictions and their access to marine species and have a direct impact
            on their economic survival.
                Inland fisheries — most of which are in developing African and Asian countries and
            support direct food security — are also at high risk to changes in water availability and
            quality, threatening the food supply and livelihoods of some of the world’s poorest
            populations.
                We cannot leave these vulnerable communities without options. Communities
            dependent on fisheries and aquaculture will need our support to transition to new
            species or fishing zones to make better use of resources in the face of scarcity or to exit
            the sector if necessary.
                There is much we can do at the household and community level to support the
            resilience of the sector from within — we should ensure they receive timely weather
            information even while at sea so as to improve the safety of fishing vessels and fishers.
            We should support them to monitor and analyse local changes and have access to global
            information. We should provide them with social protection when they need it and
            help them transition to new fishing and fish-farming methods and zones to adapt to
            the changes they are perceiving. We should improve post-harvest processes to improve
            their energy efficiency and to minimize losses resulting from spoilage and disease risks.
                We should also provide them with enabling environments such as secure tenure and
            access rights to the natural resources upon which small-scale fisheries and aquaculture
            depend. We should promote adaptive fisheries co-management plans, legislate
            vulnerability assessments within the sector and ensure that our development strategies
            and policies are both climate proofed and disaster proofed.
                We should ensure that the needs of the sector are included in national and regional
            climate change discussions and require that adaptation and mitigation measures in one
            sector do not negatively affect food security and livelihoods in other sectors, such as
            fisheries.
Report of the conference                                                                   7




   We should also promote climate resilient forms of aquaculture, especially of
herbivore species and non-fed species, which when well planned and managed, have
great potential for sustainable growth in the face of climate change. Not only can the
aquaculture systems provide healthy food and nutrition with a comparatively low
greenhouse gas footprint, but they can also provide an alternative food production
system in areas no longer appropriate for land farming because of sea level rise or
saltwater intrusion.
   Fisheries and aquaculture and their dependent communities are at the frontline of
climate change impacts. We must safeguard the most vulnerable who rely on the sector
— already under stress from pollution, habitat degradation, overfishing and harmful
practices — from greater threats caused by climate variability, climate change and
ocean acidification. And we must also enable them to avail themselves of opportunities
as they arise.
   FAO and its partners are working together to reduce the vulnerabilities of those
most dependent on fisheries and aquaculture for their existence. FAO is supporting
countries in their implementation of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible
Fisheries, the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries and Aquaculture, and the recently
adopted Voluntary Guidelines for Small-Scale Fisheries, which remind us to recognize
and take into account the differential impacts of natural and human-induced disasters
and climate change on small-scale fisheries. These will take us far in increasing the
resilience of the most vulnerable populations, with livelihoods depending on fisheries
and aquaculture in areas vulnerable to climate change.
   During these three days, we will discuss efforts to support adaptation in fisheries
and aquaculture in different parts of the world. Let us take this opportunity to engage
in lively debates, widen our circle of colleagues and friends, and reflect on the next
steps for ensuring a climate resilient sector.

Dr Cherdsak Virapat, Director General, Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-
Pacific (NACA) extended a very warm welcome to the conference participants:
The FishAdapt Conference will provide participants the opportunity to share on
the ground experiences in undertaking climate change vulnerability assessments and
implementing adaptation actions within the fisheries and aquaculture sector and its
dependent communities. The focus will be on applied vulnerability assessments and
adaptation planning and implementation activities, but may also include sharing of
experiences on how oceanographic, limnology, biological and bio-economic modelling
applications have been used to support specific adaptation policies and planning
activities within regions, countries, sectors and dependent communities.

The conference is expected to provide:
   • increased understanding of plausible adaptation measures in different regional
      and ecosystem settings among researchers, practitioners and managers;
   • conference proceedings documenting shared experiences and recommendations
      for the future;
   • scientific journal articles reviewing adaptation measures in different ecosystems;
   • a body of information to keep the FAO Committee on Fisheries abreast of
      developments; and
   • input into UNFCCC processes through the Nairobi Work Plan, the UNFCCC
      Least Developed Countries Expert Group and the UNFCCC Adaptation
      Committee, etc.
   On behalf of NACA, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere
thanks to FAO and in particular to Ms. Cassandra De Young and NACA colleagues
for their efforts in planning that made this conference possible. I’d also like to thank
the Scientific Committee listed in Annex 1, all collaborating partners and each expert
8   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




            that has contributed already and will make further contributions to the success of
            this conference. I would also like to acknowledge our sponsors FAO, the Norwegian
            Agency for Development Cooperation, the Kingdom of Thailand’s Department of
            Fisheries, the Government of Japan, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
            Fisheries of the United States of America, the World Meteorological Organization, the
            International Atomic Energy Agency’s Ocean Acidification International Coordination
            Centre, and Rare.

            CONFERENCE SUMMARY
            One hundred and ten participants from 27 countries attended the FishAdapt
            Conference, which comprised 45 presentations and plenaries, and four special sessions
            (see Annex 3 for a complete list of presentations). Discussions considered international,
            national and regional fisheries and aquaculture adaptation priorities, and supporting
            policy and investment. The diverse presentations raised key points that represent future
            directions and challenges for the sector in implementing climate change adaptation.
               The scaling up of local and national adaptation to support and meet global adaptation
            goals set the scene for the conference. An overview by Paul Desanker, UNFCCC,
            of the evolution of global Conference of the Parties (COP) commitments, and
            scaling up local adaptation through National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), particularly
            for least-developed countries, highlighted the need for coordination to include all
            sectors. Global adaptation goals aim to enhance adaptive capacity, build resilience and
            reduce vulnerability in an effort to meet the global climate target of less than a 2°C
            temperature increase. The establishment of the Adaptation Committee has provided
            a process to establish NAPs to address issues associated with loss and damage. NAPs
            have two objectives: 1) reduce vulnerability; and 2) integrate adaptation into national
            planning. Future support for nations is available through the Green Climate Fund
            (GCF) — specific funding for the NAP process — and new guidance is emerging from
            the GCF Secretariat on accessing funding and ways to develop dedicated resources to
            access the GCF.
               Gender dimensions in climate change adaptation, gleaning from 20 years of the
            gender working group in the Asia Fisheries Society, was presented by Meryl Williams
            and highlighted some key gaps and challenges. We were urged to re-think our concept
            of gender equity and advised how to incorporate gender into climate change adaptation,
            moving away from gender stereotypes. Gender dimensions are still not fully included
            in vulnerability assessments or adaptations for fisheries and aquaculture, and gender
            considerations are absent from the main policy tools (except the recent Small-scale
            Fisheries Guidelines). The gender lens provides the best opportunity to understand the
            system and implement effective adaptation solutions, and a greater focus on gender is
            needed in future work.
               The role of science in informing policy and decision-making for climate change
            adaptation was highlighted in a number of presentations. A case study presented by Bill
            Dewey, Taylor Shellfish, demonstrated the impacts of ocean acidification on shellfish
            aquaculture on the west coast of the United States of America, and how collaboration
            with researchers and proactive responses to monitor ocean conditions have supported
            the industry’s efforts to adapt to future ocean acidification events and change. Julia
            Sanders, Global Ocean Health, reported on how science is rapidly progressing on
            climate change and communication updates on ocean conditions and acidification and
            how this fills a need for practitioners and industry, and there is increasing demand
            for incorporating science into decision-making. Two presentations on ClimeFish by
            Michaela Aschan and Petter Olsen, Artic University of Norway, also demonstrated
            how science is providing decision-support for fisheries management and seafood
            production. Doris Soto emphasised the critical importance of long-term trends for
            decision-making to provide information for early warning and rapid adaptation, long-
Report of the conference                                                                   9




term behavioural change and investment predictability. Johanna Johnson, C2O Pacific,
presented examples from the Pacific region where science is informing fisheries and
aquaculture planning and policy, and being downscaled to support resource-dependent
communities. Maria Gasalla, University of Sao Paulo, provided key highlights from
the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea/the North Pacific Marine
Science Organization and the Intergovernmental Oceanic Commission (ICES/PICES/
IOC) Third Symposium on the effects of climate change on the world’s oceans held
in Santos, Federative Republic of Brazil in 2015. Importantly, all these presentations
highlight that having access to current scientific information is critical for effective
adaptation in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.

THEME 1: APPLIED RISK/VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS IN FISHERIES AND
AQUACULTURE
Theme 1 began with an overview by Cassandra De Young, FAO, of vulnerability
assessment methods and contextual approaches, supported by many case studies
demonstrating the utility of the approach to fisheries and aquaculture in different
regions. Practical examples were presented from the Western Indian Ocean, the
People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Lake Chad, the Republic of Ghana, African Great
Lakes, the Republic of India, Torres Strait, the Caribbean, and the Federative Republic
of Brazil, in a range of ecosystems, including inland and marine capture fisheries. Iris
Monnereau showed that method matters and can influence vulnerability outcomes,
particularly with the indicators and weightings that are selected. There was a clear
focus throughout all presentations on small-scale fisheries, which is not surprising
since they are critical for resource-dependent communities and are most at risk from
climate change.
   A recurring message in Theme 1 sessions was the difficulty of disentangling
climate change impacts from responses to other pressures. This was demonstrated for
small-scale fisheries in Lake Tanganyika, Lake Chad Basin and the Lower Mekong,
where dams, increasing population and demand for food, and agriculture are having
significant impacts on freshwater systems, particularly modifying freshwater flows,
that currently overshadow any climate change impacts. Future adaptations will need
to focus on these immediate sources of impacts as a priority.
   The integration of ecological, social and cultural information to understand
and assess vulnerability to climate change was presented, with a case study from
the Federative Republic of Brazil showing how fishers’ perceptions of changes in
climate and empirical data can complement each other. An integrated vulnerability
assessment from Torres Strait presented by David Welch, C2O Fisheries, also
demonstrated how social indicators can be integrated into assessment methods, and
cultural values applied to prioritize adaptation actions. A case study from India
presented by Arpita Sharma, Indian Council for Agricultural Research-Central
Institute of Fisheries Education (ICAR-CIFE), considered the different perceptions
of climate change risk by men and women and found that women perceive greater
livelihood vulnerability. Thus gender differences need to be taken into account when
designing climate change adaptations. Cultural and gender aspects and traditional
knowledge are increasingly being recognized as key information sources and
important to assess vulnerability to climate change holistically and inform effective
adaptation of fisheries and aquaculture.

THEME 2: CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION EFFORTS IN FISHERIES AND
AQUACULTURE
The participants continued sharing experiences on the ground in climate change
adaptation in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Case studies of local and regional
adaptation initiatives were presented from the Republic of Indonesia, the Republic
10   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             of Philippines, and the Republic of India. A series of presentations about community
             adaptation after Typhoon Haiyan outlined the success of strengthening the value
             chain and involving women to support the quick recovery of livelihoods in affected
             communities. However, it is important to have the right enablers and that requires
             human capacity building. Similar case studies were presented for fishing communities
             impacted by flooding in the Republic of India and the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.
             Government support to fishing communities, including early warning systems, disaster
             preparedness, higher spending on infrastructure rebuilding, diversification initiatives
             and post-disaster loans were shown to reduce damages and support faster recovery.
                Throughout the presentations some key messages emerged in terms of effective
             fisheries adaptations, including: implementation of best management practices (e.g.
             use of existing fisheries management tools to ensure sustainable use of resources such
             as an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM), ensuring adaptation is
             context specific, incorporating local knowledge into adaptation planning, and scaling
             up local actions to regional scale. Many good examples of on the ground aquaculture
             adaptations are available because it is easier to control the system inputs and
             environment, e.g. constructing deeper ponds, moving cages into deeper, cooler waters,
             co-culture with plants to reduce acidification. Furthermore, there are different types of
             adaptation: those within the sector that aim to decrease the impacts of climate change
             and those outside the sector that involve changes to external drivers of change or exit
             from the industry. These types of adaptations have variable success rates and are not
             well documented.
                Another key message was that there are still gaps in moving from identifying
             and understanding impacts to implementing effective adaptations. This was in part
             demonstrated by a review of five years of peer-review scientific literature where the
             number of papers published on climate change adaptation increased but there were few
             examples of observed or implemented adaptations, partly because of knowledge gaps
             (or lack of documentation of on the ground activities).

             THEME 3: LINKING FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE ADAPTATION TO BROADER
             PROCESSES
             A number of presentations explored the links between the fisheries and aquaculture
             sector and broader processes, such as financial and insurance mechanisms. Integrating
             climate change impacts and vulnerability into domestic development planning and
             budgets is critical to secure sufficient support for adaptation, e.g. setting up bridging
             credit funds. These efforts at integration should be supported by training and capacity
             building in sectors outside fisheries and aquaculture to understand the implications of
             climate change for food security and livelihoods.
                Consideration of insurance measures to assist fisheries and aquaculture adapt to
             climate change or recover from climate disturbances revealed that most mechanisms
             are not adequate, and alternative insurance measures are needed that are tailored to the
             specific needs of the sector.

             THEME 4: COMMUNICATING CLIMATE CHANGE AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS
             Communicating and disseminating accurate information about climate change impacts,
             vulnerability and adaptation is important for ensuring informed decision-making and
             eliciting behavioural change where necessary. A number of presentations provided
             insight into current efforts to communicate climate change information. These
             included presentations on:
                • Organization of the Central American Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector
                    (OSPESCA) efforts to add climate change to the political agenda in Central
                    America and support the development of a sub-regional climate change strategy;

  • NGOs using social marketing to promote behavioural change and sustainable
    practices in fisheries;
  • the importance of sharing scientific knowledge and creating accessible outreach
    material for communicating climate change information to communities;
  • avoiding misleading and alarming messages, and highlighting positive actions to
    empower communities;
  • the importance of early-warning systems for climate events that affect fisheries
    and aquaculture sectors; and
  • how effective communications can engender social cohesion, networking and
    collective action to support adaptations.

SPECIAL SESSIONS
Four parallel special sessions were held on the following topics, with selected summary
papers available in the contributed papers section.
  1. Climate change in small-scale fisheries: vulnerability, adaptive capacity and
     responses.
  2. Integrating gender considerations into climate change and disaster risk reduction
     strategies for fishing communities.
  3. Charting a course after Paris: leveraging NDCs for action to address climate
     challenges for fisheries and aquaculture in the Asia-Pacific region.
  4. Mangrove-based fisheries and aquaculture in support of climate change adaptation.

GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The conference provided a forum to share practical experience on climate change
vulnerability assessment and adaptation initiatives, and demonstrated that much can
be done at the household, community and sector levels to support the resilience of
the sector in a changing climate. However, some key knowledge gaps emerged that
need to be considered, specifically: incorporation of gender dimensions into future
assessments and adaptation actions; post-harvest methods to enhance livelihood
opportunities; access to markets and international trade; the need for small island states
and inland fisheries to be better represented in global initiatives; the role of governance
and institutions; and comparisons of short-term versus long-term adaptations that
can address different timescales and therefore impacts. These areas provide future
directions for research and management, as well as themes for future conferences in
this field.

ABSTRACT
This paper provided an overview of the Third International Symposium on the Effects
of Climate Change on the World’s Oceans, which was held from 23 to 27 March,
2015 in Santos, Brazil. Almost 300 scientists participated in thematic sessions covering
biogeochemistry aspects and evolutionary responses on biodiversity, pathways to
sustain marine ecosystem services under climate change, and coastal communities and
management objectives. The parallel symposium workshops covered mostly processes
on projecting climate change impacts, acidification, carbon pumps, upwelling,
climate-ready fishery systems and regional comparisons. Relatively few presentations
mentioned adaptation to climate change, and, while several discussed effects for capture
fisheries, aquaculture and gender were underrepresented.

INTRODUCTION
The effects of climate change on the world’s oceans were discussed in an international
symposium convened in Santos, Brazil by the International Council for the Exploration
of the Sea, the North Pacific Marine Science Organization, and the Intergovernmental
Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO in March 2015; having the Oceanographic
Institute, University of São Paulo as the local organizer (ICES, 2014). As the third of a
series that started in Gijon, Spain - with the aim to capture the latest scientific knowledge
on ocean change as a preparation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
and followed by a second symposium in Yeosu, Korea - the symposium in Brazil
showed new scientific developments and challenges, some of which have implications
for the fisheries and aquaculture sector. The symposium provided aAn overview of
scientific contributions that inform footprints to the fisheries food production and
security, highlights knowledge gaps and societal and political challenges relevant to
develop adaptation at the local community scale. Here, some key general messages are
pointed out as well as several lessons learned that may orientate future global-scale
symposia on this topic.

SUMMARY RESULTS
The uncertainties about future vulnerability, exposure and responses of interlinked
marine human and natural systems are large, which motivates the exploration of a wide
range of socioeconomic futures in all the assessments of risks. This seems particularly
challenging due to the number of interacting social, economic, and cultural factors,
which have been incompletely considered to date. These factors include wealth and

             its distribution across society, demographics, migration, access to technology and
             information, employment patterns, the quality of adaptive responses, societal values,
             governance structures, and institutions to resolve conflicts. International dimensions,
             such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks
             of climate change at regional scales.
                Modelling ocean behavior is an important scientific contribution to the fisheries and
             aquaculture sector and the speed of impact of climate change in the oceans seems to
             depend on the stressor considered (e.g., temperature, oxygen, and primary production).
             Some of the global models’ projections show that model resolution matters: low
             resolution models are still useful to generate hypotheses but high resolution models are
             increasing important to projecting changes in fisheries catches.
                During the symposium, predicted changes in marine species’ distributions were
             shown, emphasizing a generic poleward shift. Between 25-85% of animals monitored
             are shifting where they live, but these changes are heterogeneously distributed.
                Phenology was also an important topic for the symposium, and its impacts seem
             to depend on species life history. For example, in the case of small pelagics in Japan,
             Pacific sardine size at age is predicted to remain the same, because it can utilize more of
             the subarctic region as a feeding ground. Pacific saury, on the other hand, has already
             exploited the subarctic region for its feeding ground and, thus, size at age may decrease
             as a result. The match/mismatch theory seemed resurrected within the research
             presented and included trends in blooms initiation/delays and spawning durations.
             The big unknowns were the upwelling systems, which show complex phenological
             responses.
                Important confirmations were seen on ocean acidification, where acclimation
             periods and rates matter and can also be transgenerational: experiences by parents
             influencing offspring responses in some fish.
                All regional comparisons of climate adaptation in marine fisheries were predominantly
             more developed country-oriented, and the session on impacts to coastal communities
             more developing country-oriented. There is still a question on which countries are
             really moving towards climate-ready fishery systems? From the presentations, it seems
             that those more focused on top-down approaches (government-science-users) should
             be in that process. Considering some lessons from developed nations such as Australia,
             United States, United Kingdom and France, some key points:
                • Anticipatory planning, early-observations, seasonal distribution forecasts, supply
                   chains modelling, and input/output controls are part of the adaptation, technical
                   support and conservation measures proposed in Australia. But even there,
                   options seem moderate, with few long-term actions.
                • The United States was more focused on fisheries management and harvest control
                   rules (HCR), risk management, and adaptation behavior. Agencies seem to be
                   opened to improve their management systems and to incorporate climate change.
                • In the United Kingdom, collaborative monitoring, best practices to more
                   abundant species, methods to increase flexibility, diversification of consumer
                   demand seem to be part of a solid organizational adaptive capacity scheme.
                • From France, projections for tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean showed impacts by
                   shifting habitats east and poleward towards international waters, where fishing
                   effort is increasing and control is more difficult. One example of a developed
                   country capability applied to developing countries was highlighted.
                The impacts of climate change on marine ecosystem production across nations was
             also highlighted; underscoring the importance of jobs, economy and food security.
             Dependency determines impacts, and in societies dependent on fisheries, the potential
             catches are predicted to change.
                Climate change has increased the frequency of cyclones in Asia, and climatic
             variables have severe impacts on coastal aquaculture of prawn and shrimp farming,

reduced export earning, impacts on livelihoods of coastal poor, effects on households’
income, and impacts on economic growth. Thus, increased poverty and vulnerability
in coastal nations may be expected.
   On the importance of communicating climate change, “non-threatening images that
relate to every-day emotions and concerns tend to be the most engaging” (O’Neill and
Nicholson-Cole, 2009).
   On the symposium’s participation, there were about 290 delegates, quite gendered-
balanced with 45% female participation, predominantly from North America and
Oceania (Australia), and only 3% from South America (except Brazil) and 1% from
Africa. Theme sessions covered mostly biogeochemistry aspects and evolutionary
responses on biodiversity, pathways to sustain marine ecosystem services under
climate change, and one session on coastal communities and management objectives.
The symposium workshops covered mostly processes on projecting climate change
impacts, acidification, carbon pumps, upwelling, climate-ready fishery systems and
regional comparisons, with only 16 presentations mentioning adaptation, 32 fisheries,
just one on aquaculture and gender. There were no presentations on fisheries and
aquaculture adaptation from South American countries.

CONCLUSIONS
  • Oceans are important climate integrators (role in CO2 absorption, atmospheric
    heat accumulation, continental waters recipient), the cost of which being: ocean
    acidification, ocean warming, deoxygenation, sea level rise, etc.
  • Climate change in oceans poses serious questions on various human-
    related dimensions including food security.
  • Ocean changes due to climate change are an urgent matter for the Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs).
  • Climate change management is about managing risk. Science can explain
    the need for change, characterize the types of things that are expected to happen,
    but we cannot answer questions about exactly what will change by how much
    and when. We should be looking to support policies of transition and adaptive
    response. Precaution is managing risk, not avoiding it.
  • Much needed research includes adaptation that goes beyond conservation
    strategies, (adaptation plans mostly responsive to conservation plans) and more
    ground experiences reporting (from the sector: what factors are important to
    climate change adaptation?) Also, more research is needed on the understanding
    of people’s behaviour, beliefs, and perceptions of climate change. More research
    is also needed to help moving from impacts to adaptation: understanding
    vulnerability is extremely important, but what about the plans to reduce
    vulnerabilities at the different scales? As resilience components are non-linear
    relationships, complexity science will also be important.
  • The fisheries and aquaculture sector should benefit from marine sciences
    although the topic remains secondary in the Climate/Oceanography community
    (e.g. ICES/PICES/IOC).
  • There are still several gaps in adaptation research to fisheries and aquaculture.
    And there are also opportunities for new technologies and social movements, as
    well for a broader science integration.
  • South America and Africa were the least-covered regions, even within a scientific
    symposium organized in Brazil.
  • Aquaculture and fisheries are part of marine sciences: interactions and inclusions
    should be explored further. Different communities of scientists that often do not
    match in symposia should be more integrated. If we aim to cope with the effects
    of climate change on the word’s marine fisheries and aquaculture production and
    food security, that integration should be important.

Vulnerability assessments in
fisheries socio-ecological systems:
some experiences in their
development and implementation
for adaptation planning

ABSTRACT
From relatively limited and narrow use two decades ago, the concept of vulnerability
has emerged as a key dimension of the development debate. Whether in relation to
climate change, natural hazards, globalization and economic development, or socio–
ecological system changes more generally, vulnerability is a complex and multifaceted
concept that has attracted the attention of scholars and development practitioners
from all disciplines. The many interpretations of vulnerability and its many scales
(e.g. individual, community, ecosystem, countries, and continents) and fields of
application have led to a wide array of propositions regarding ways and means by
which vulnerability could be studied, characterized, understood, and acted upon. This
multitude of approaches and methodologies of assessment has enabled new insights
into the causes and consequences of vulnerability, but has also caused some confusion
among practitioners and led to the voicing of a need for clarification and guidance on
how best to approach the study of vulnerability. This paper, primarily based on earlier
work by Brugère and De Young (2015), provides a brief overview of vulnerability
assessment concepts and methodologies. It sheds light on the different vulnerability
assessment methodologies that have been developed and how these methodologies
have been applied in the context of fisheries and aquaculture, with illustrative examples
of their application.

INTRODUCTION
Vulnerability assessments play an important role in the climate change adaptation
process (UNFCCC, 2011) in that they link physical changes (either current or
projected) with the ability of aquatic and human systems to cope or benefit from such
changes. In general, a vulnerability assessment helps to target adaptation actions by
better understanding:
  1. who the vulnerable people\species are and how their vulnerability can be reduced;
  2. where the vulnerable ecosystems are and whether resource management can
      improve their capacity to adapt;
  3. where the economic consequences of the vulnerability of fishery systems will be
      felt most and how we can plan to minimize those consequences; and
  4. where climate change will create new opportunities and bring benefits and,
      importantly, for whom.
22   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




                 In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) developed a generic
             model to assist in understanding the multiple facets of vulnerability as “a function of
             the sensitivity of a system to changes in climate (the degree to which a system will
             respond to a given change in climate, including beneficial and harmful effects), adaptive
             capacity (the degree to which adjustments in practices, processes, or structures can
             moderate or offset the potential for damage or take advantage of opportunities created
             by a given change in climate), and the degree of exposure of the system to climatic
             hazards” (IPCC, 2001). The specific vulnerability questions asked (i.e. vulnerability
             of whom/what? and what changes and why?) and the methodologies used to answer
             these questions are often influenced by the background and disciplinary training of
             the assessor. That is, an assessment stemming from risk/hazard, resilience or political
             economy traditions may place different emphasis on the various elements underlying
             vulnerability, such as whether the hazard itself and its impacts are the main elements of
             concern or, perhaps, whether differential susceptibility to such change is important or
             whether there are tipping points to such susceptibility. In addition, different disciplines
             (i.e. natural or social sciences) may also frame the vulnerability assessment in different
             ways, such as focusing on the vulnerability of the natural system or the human system
             or whether underlying and existing vulnerability to change determines a system’s
             ability to adapt to a climate related driver (focusing on the source of vulnerability)
             versus a more linear impacts assessment approach. Understanding the array of different
             perspectives and methodologies (Figure 1) is necessary to support integrated fisheries
             and aquaculture vulnerability assessments that combine multidisciplinary factors
             influencing socio-ecological systems.
                 The fisheries and aquaculture sector is gaining experience in applying the IPCC
             framework; allowing for the development of initial guidance on vulnerability
             assessment processes for the sector (FAO, 2013). Seven examples in capture fisheries
             and aquaculture that show a breadth of different purposes for the assessment, scales,
             scopes and methodologies are provided below.

EXAMPLE 1 – National economies’ vulnerability to climate change 2

Vulnerability question
How are national economies vulnerable to potential climate change impacts affecting
their fisheries?

Purpose of the assessment
As the first global assessment for the fisheries sector, the purpose of this assessment
was to raise general awareness within the sector and within the climate change world
of potential impacts from increasing temperatures. It also aimed to show how the
vulnerability of national economies to changes stemming from the fisheries sector is
not limited to areas of greatest temperature changes but also to those economies with
high dependence on the sector and low adaptive capacity. The vulnerability framework
used for the study is shown in Figure 2.

             EXAMPLE 2 – Climate change vulnerability of Pacific SIDS economies4

             Vulnerability question
             How are the economies of Pacific small island developing states (SIDS) vulnerable to
             climate change through potential changes in tuna fisheries?

             Purpose of the assessment
             One of a series5 of vulnerability assessments for the region that had several purposes.
             The first purpose was to provide information to fisheries managers and policymakers
             on the vulnerability to climate change of fisheries and aquaculture resources in the
             Pacific. Recommendations were provided on how best to adapt and ensure that the
             benefits from fisheries and aquaculture are maintained in the years to come. The second
             purpose was to produce a valuable resource for anyone wanting to learn about the
             diverse oceanic, coastal and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture activities of the Pacific
             Islands region, and the environmental conditions and habitats that support them, thus
             raising awareness about the immense value of this socio–ecological system.

                 The authors also evaluated the vulnerability of fisheries-dependent livelihoods through projected effects
                 of climate change on all fisheries resources and aquaculture, and the vulnerability of coastal communities
                 to changes in food security resulting from climate change.

             EXAMPLE 3 – Vulnerable fisheries in the Torres Strate6

             Vulnerability question
             What are the most vulnerable fisheries in the Torres Strait region to future climate change?

             Purpose of the assessment
             The assessment was carried out to fulfil a national priority to better understand the
             likely effects of climate change on Australia’s fisheries. The main purpose though was
             to provide information to fisheries managers on the vulnerability to climate change
             of fisheries in Torres Strait, and to identify the priority fisheries on which to focus
             resources. In addition, the results were communicated to Torres Strait Islanders,
             fishers and managers to help them understand what the main climate change impacts
             are likely to be, what fisheries are expected to be most vulnerable, and to help them
             use this information to prepare for and adapt to negative effects and to capitalize on
             opportunities.

             Vulnerability framework
             The framework for the study is shown in Figure 5.

                 Framework used for vulnerability assessment of the Torres Strait region Data and methods




             Data and methods
             The assessors used a semi-quantitative approach to address specific management
             objectives with multdisciplinary indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
             capacity. The indicators and scoring criteria underwent a rigorous selection and
             expert review process. Indicators were scored using: (1) available literature; (2) expert
             assessment; and (3) local Indigenous fisher knowledge.

             Exposure — 8 indicators:
             1) Surface temperature increase                2) Rainfall change
             3) pH decline                                  4) Salinity decrease
             5) Habitat changes                             6) Altered wind/currents
             7) Tropical cyclone intensity                  8) More extreme riverflow

5) Physiological tolerance of stock                                        6) Reliance on environmental cues
7) Reliance on temporal cues

Adaptive capacity — 9 indicators:
1) Stock status                                                            2) Replenishment potential
3) Ability to range shift                                                  4) Species mobility
5) Non-fishing pressures on stock                                          6) Resource dependence (occupational mobility)
7) Willingness to change practices                                         8) Climate change awareness
9) Governance structure.

Prioritization was based on a fishery importance (FI) index calculated using:
FI index = Ec + (2*C). Where Ec is the economic value and C is the cultural value.

             EXAMPLE 4 – Socio-ecological vulnerability of Kenyan coral reef fisheries7

             Vulnerability question
             What is the socio-ecological vulnerability of coral reef fisheries to climate change?

             Purpose of the assessment
             This study piloted a VA method to help countries, development agencies and their
             staff, researchers and fisheries professionals to understand how to define and measure
             vulnerability within complex fisheries systems, using risks of coral reef bleaching in
             Kenyan reef-dependent fishing communities as an example. Ultimately, the scope of
             this work was to improve resilience of fisheries systems and dependent communities to
             multiple drivers of change including climate change and ocean acidification.

             Vulnerability framework
             The framework is shown in Figure 7.

             EXAMPLE 5 – Socio-ecological vulnerabilities of fisheries-dependent
             communities in the Benguela Current Region8

             Vulnerability question
             What are the socio-ecological vulnerabilities of fisheries-dependent communities in the
             Benguela Current region in relation to climate change and environmental variability,
             including impacts of other sector activities that may exacerbate vulnerability?

             Purpose of assessment
             The rapid assessment allowed communities to identify potential threats, strengths and
             opportunities as well as existing coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies as part
             of a community-based adaptation process.

             Vulnerability framework
             Vulnerability was defined as the extent to which a socio-ecological system (coastal
             fishery system) is susceptible to various socio-ecological changes (including the effects
             of climate change) and the system’s capacity to adapt to and cope with these changes
             and effects from the viewpoint of local communities. Here, vulnerability is inherent in
             a social system, i.e. social conditions, historical circumstances and political economy of
             groups, and is in effect independent of climate aspects. The conceptual framework used
             was the “360° (degrees) integrated assessment” to assess vulnerability to different social
             and ecological stressors, and to map out linkages between these factors, i.e. influence
             of one factor on another.

             Data and methods
             In each community, using participatory assessment tools, a profile and map of the
             socio-ecological system were drawn up, perceptions of threats from all sources were
             identified, and vulnerabilities were assessed in terms of geographical location, fishery,
             and post-harvest activities as well as the different groups affected such as children,
             women groups, and institutions. Coping and adaptation mechanisms were then
             discussed and key adaptation options were highlighted. This rapid assessment was
             done during a two-day workshop consisting of several dedicated plenary discussions,
             group exercises and key informant interviews or focus group meetings.

             Presentation of vulnerability assessment findings
             The results of each step in the assessment are compiled through graphics and tables
             of current and needed adaptation strategies (See Figure 9). These were then used to
             identify existing adaptation strategies as well as additional strategies needed.

EXAMPLE 6 – Species and production systems’ vulnerabilities in the Lower
Mekong Basin9

Vulnerability question
How are Lower Mekong Basin fisheries and aquaculture species and production
systems vulnerable to predicted climate change impacts?

Purpose of assessment
Under the Mekong Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change (ARCC) project, a
series of climate change vulnerability and adaptation studies were undertaken for the
water resources, food security, livelihoods, and biodiversity of the Lower Mekong
Basin (LMB). The studies laid the foundation for the whole USAID Mekong ARCC
project by providing the scientific evidence base for identifying highly vulnerable
and valuable agricultural and natural systems assets in the LMB, defining adaptation
options and priorities, and guiding the selection of focal areas for enhancing existing
adaptation strategies and demonstrating and testing new approaches.

Vulnerability framework
The definitions of vulnerability adopted for the studies were based on the IPCC
model of vulnerability tailored to the fisheries and aquaculture species and production
systems.

Data and methods
Depending on the eco-zone, drivers of change included: increased temperatures;
increased or decreased precipitation; decreased water availability; drought; flooding;

                       storms and flash flooding; sea-level rise; and increased salinity. These exposure variables,
                       using available projections to 2050 for each zone, were matched to information, such
                       as: status of the species (IUCN red list status – invasive, least concern, vulnerable,
                       endangered); water quality requirements and tolerances; migratory patterns; breeding
                       season; diet; current trends and threats. Expert judgement was used to examine
                       exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of capture fisheries species and aquaculture
                       systems (e.g. extensive pond culture, semi-intensive pond culture, cage culture) and
                       related species (e.g. tilapia, silver barb and carps).

                       Presentation of vulnerability assessment findings
                       For each eco-zone, results of information compilations were provided in tables listing
                       evaluations (high, medium, low rankings) of the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
                       capacity of species and processes to each environmental threat (see Table 2 and Table 3
                       for examples). Vulnerability assessments for evaluated species and systems were then
                       presented for comparison based on low, medium, high, and very high vulnerability
                       rankings. Adaptation options were then proposed for species/production system
                       relative to their relevance in each eco-zone studied.

EXAMPLE 7 – Marine fish and invertebrate species vulnerabilities in the
United States of America10

Vulnerability question
Which marine fish and invertebrate species have life histories and exposures that may
leave them vulnerable to large changes in abundance or productivity?

Purpose of assessment
A VA methodology was created to be applicable across marine ecosystems of the
United States of America. The results provide insight into which species are likely
to be the most vulnerable to climate change and identify the key drivers behind the
vulnerability. Scientists, managers and fishers are expected to use this information as
they prepare for and adapt to future conditions.

Vulnerability framework
The basic IPCC model of vulnerability was modified such that vulnerability is a
combination of exposure and sensitivity, where sensitivity includes the adaptive
capacity of the species. The sensitivity component was divided into 12 sensitivity
attributes and the exposure component was divided into a number of exposure factors
(Figure 10).
   Climate exposure was defined as the overlap between the species distribution and
the magnitude of the expected environmental change. Exposure factors considered

             varied depending on what environmental factors are important to the region of interest,
             but included sea surface temperature, air temperature, pH, salinity, precipitation,
             currents and sea-level rise. Sensitivity was defined as the inherent biological attributes
             of a species that are predictive of their ability/inability to respond to potential
             environmental changes.

             Data and methods
             The methodology relied on technical experts using species profiles, based on the
             scientific literature and general knowledge to provide a score for each species for each
             sensitivity attribute and for each exposure factor. Both individual and group expert
             elicitation practices were used to minimize bias and increase precision of the results.
             The methodology allowed experts to account for their uncertainty when assigning a
             score. Experts had five “tallies” for each sensitivity attribute and exposure factor, which
             they distributed among four scoring bins (low, moderate, high or very high) depending
             on their confidence in the score as well as a data quality score for each attribute.
                 The authors used three steps to combine expert tallies into a final vulnerability
             rank for each species. First, they calculated the sensitivity attribute and exposure
             factor means based on the distribution of all expert tallies across the four scoring bins.
             Second, they calculated component scores for exposure and vulnerability based on a
             logic model. Finally, exposure was multiplied by sensitivity to calculate the overall
             vulnerability score.

             Presentation of vulnerability assessment findings
             Results of the first implementation of the assessment for 82 species found in the
             Northeast United States Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem were presented to
             summarize results as a whole as well as for individual species (Table 4 shows the results
             for Spanish mackerel). Species narratives were provided, detailing overall vulnerability
             rank, the exposure factors and life-history attributes that led to that rank, as well as a
             discussion of data quality and future research priorities.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The recommendations that stem from these examples and existing experiences include:
  a) the importance of clearly defining the vulnerability question to be answered and
     the purpose of the assessment as the starting points of any assessment;
  b) understanding that the scale, approach and method of vulnerability analysis
     should be determined by its purpose but will be influenced by resources, time,
     expertise and availability of data;
  c) the benefits of combining top-down and bottom-up analyses, linking social and
     ecological vulnerabilities, keeping indicators simple, clearly defining pathways of
     impact and keeping policy/practice objectives in focus; and
  d) acknowledging that a vulnerability assessment is a means to an end and that
     a detailed and costly vulnerability assessment may not be necessary as many
     climate-change adaptations are “no regrets” actions.

ABSTRACT
To explore if women and men in fisheries-dependent livelihoods perceive climate
change vulnerability differently, a study was undertaken in the Bhadra reservoir,
Karnataka State of the Republic of India. The reservoir, which is a source of fresh water,
is under stress because of climate change (temperature and precipitation changes),
continuing growth in human freshwater consumption and rising needs of agricultural
and energy development. A composite livelihood vulnerability index with exposure,
sensitivity and adaptive capacity parameters, was computed. This incorporated the
sustainable livelihoods approach to understanding sensitivity and adaptive capacity
along with rainfall and temperature trends representing exposure to climate drivers.
It was found that women and men experience climate change vulnerability differently.
Normalized vulnerability scores ranged from 0 (not vulnerable) to 1 (extremely
vulnerable) and women had a highly vulnerable score of 0.40 and men with a score of
0.34 were moderately vulnerable. Women perceived that they were more at risk than
men regarding the perceived effects of climate change on livelihood assets. Both men
and women reported that financial capital will be affected in most of the livelihood
asset categories. The differences in perception of men and women were found to
be statistically significant, suggesting a need to have gender assessments. Fishing
communities are dependent on natural resources and women and men experience
climate change differently, because of their social and economic roles.

INTRODUCTION
Calls to take action to meet the interlinked global challenges of climate change and
sustainable development are being made continuously. Sources of fresh water, for
example, have been put under tremendous stress from the continuing growth in
human fresh water consumption, as well as the rising water needs of agricultural
and energy development. This is a concern for the Indian economy, which is tied to
natural resources and can be severely impacted by climate change effects on the natural
resource base. One of the most potent impacts of climate change in the country is
alteration of the monsoon patterns and it has been reported on the website of the
Republic of India’s Meteorological Department that there is a wide range of spatial
variation because of orographic influences and preferential occurrences of rain bearing
systems in certain regions. Increased variability in monsoons can lead to water level
fluctuations in Indian reservoirs as they are very dependent on rainfall in catchment

             areas. As Indian reservoirs preserve a rich variety of fish species, which supports
             commercial fisheries (Thirumala et al., 2011), water level fluctuations in reservoirs will
             certainly affect the fisheries and impact fishers’ livelihoods. Bruinsma (2003) and FAO
             (2009) have reported that fisheries in fresh-water systems could be affected by climate
             variability and change. Climate change may affect the livelihoods of its people and Rao
             and Basuray (2006) have reported that climate change impacts are likely to be most
             severe for those who have reduced capacities to adapt to climate variability.
                This study assesses the vulnerability of fisheries-dependent livelihoods to climate
             change and whether perceived vulnerability is gender specific. The study site, the
             Bhadra reservoir, is located in the state of Karnataka. It is likely to be more vulnerable
             to climate change than other states and 54 percent of its geographical area is already
             drought prone, making the state second only to one other region, Rajasthan. The state
             possesses the third highest area of total inland water bodies with over 500 000 ha,
             comprising 73 reservoirs (IISc, 2014). Hydrologic modelling by Rao et al. (2006) of
             major river basins in the Republic of India predicts that the most severe reduction in
             runoff will occur in the Krishna Basin, which feeds the Bhadra reservoir. In addition, a
             considerable portion of the population in Karnataka is dependent on fisheries.

             METHODS
             Bhadra reservoir is one of the largest reservoirs in Karnataka. It is located at
             Chikkamagalore district and is a multipurpose project for power generation and
             irrigation. Bhadra basin gets inflows from the southwest monsoon (June to September)
             and the northeast monsoon (October to December). Average rainfall of the area is
             117 cm to 513 cm. The depth of the reservoir is about 186 feet and total length is
             1 445 feet. As reported by Bhaktha and Bandyopadhyay (2008), the fish diversity of the
             reservoir is on a decline and a few species have been lost already from this freshwater
             ecosystem. Similar results are reported by Shahnawaz et al. (2010), Thirumala et al.
             (2011) and the Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), Bangalore (IISc, 2014). Jain and
             Kumar (2012) have reported that because of uneven distribution of rainfall there is
             mismatch between water availability and demand. As per the Department of Fisheries
             (DoF), Karnataka, nine villages with about 250 to 300 fisher households are dependent
             on Bhadra reservoir. For the study, 120 fisher respondents (60 men and 60 women
             from the same households) were randomly selected and information was collected on
             various parameters with the help of an interview schedule and household discussions.
                 To assess the vulnerability of fisheries-dependent livelihood assets, a perceptions-
             based composite vulnerability index approach was developed based on the assumption
             that vulnerability “is a function of the character, magnitude and rate of climate change
             and variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity”
             (IPCC, 2001). Livelihood assets were defined using the sustainable livelihoods
             approach (Conway et al., 2002) and included human capital, natural capital, financial
             capacity, physical capital. Exposure of livelihood assets was evaluated through the
             perceived impacts of change in fish availability on household livelihood assets.
                 Information on the community’s exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to
             these climate drivers was gathered through interviews consisting of questions relating
             to the above characteristics. Respondents were asked to rank themselves on these
             parameters on a 5 point scale, which ranged from no effect (score 0) to extremely high
             effect (score 4).
                 Vulnerability was calculated by using the formula V = E * S * (1 – AC) (IPCC,
             2001). Respondents were asked how vulnerable they perceived themselves on these
             parameters on a 4 point scale which ranged from no effect (score 0) to extremely high
             effect (score 4). Primary data obtained were normalized and rescaled from 0 - 1 using
             the formula:

                                             Xmax − Xmin
Where IndexXi is a normalized value of an indicator of a household; Xi is the actual
value of the same indicator, and Xmin and Xmax are the minimum and maximum values
across the respondents, respectively, of the same indicator. Thus, scores ranged from 0
to 1 with 0 = not vulnerable, above 0 but below 0.2 = less vulnerable, above 0.2 to 0.4 =
moderately vulnerable, above 0.4 to 0.6 = highly vulnerable, above 0.6 to 0.8= very
highly vulnerable, and above 0.8 to 1 = extremely vulnerable.
   To test the hypothesis that there was a significant difference between the perceptions
of men and women, a Mann-Whitney U test was done, and to test whether differences
exist among the nine villages, a Friedman test was done.

RESULTS
It can be seen from Table 1 that the overall vulnerability score was 0.37, suggesting
fishers perceived their livelihood assets to be moderately vulnerable as, although their
exposure and sensitivity to climate drivers are perceived as very highly vulnerable,
adaptive capacity is also perceived to be very high. The average score for men was 0.34
(moderately vulnerable) and for women it was 0.40 (highly vulnerable).

   Based on the results of the Mann Whitney U test used to compare perceptions
between men and women (Table 2) no significant differences for exposure were found
as climate itself was not perceived differently between men and women. However, the
differences in perceived sensitivity and adaptation capacity between men and women
were statistically significant. This is likely a result of differences in socio-economic
settings within the household for men and women and, as per Smit and Wendel (2006),
sensitivity can be altered by socio-economic changes.

No significant difference was found in perceptions of respondents residing in different villages, probably
because of their dependence on the same reservoir for their livelihood and being economically and socially
a similar type of group. No significant difference was found in perceptions of respondents residing in

will have a greater effect on women’s livelihood assets. Both men and women reported
that financial capital assets are most affected among their livelihood assets. Differences
in perceptions between men and women were found to be statistically significant,
suggesting that there is greater need to have gender specific assessments which will help
in designing better intervention strategies benefiting both men and women. Fishers’
reported reductions in weight of Indian major carps over the years and attributed these
decreases to increases in water temperatures. Dependency of fishing communities on
this reservoir is high and possible impacts because of the changing environment are
reducing their livelihood options.
   To attain effective and equitable adaptation, an understanding of the dynamics of
vulnerability is required. Gender influences these dynamics, and therefore vulnerability
assessment must take gender differences into account. In a nutshell, this study has
revealed that women perceive that they experience greater hardship than their male
counterparts because of climate change.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This study has shown that fishing communities, who often find themselves in
vulnerable situations, perceive themselves to be affected by climate change too. Gender
differentiated vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies need to be mainstreamed into
climate change policies as impacts and adaptive capacities are perceived differently by
men and women. Such mainstreaming of gender issues would help ensure that policy
and operational responses to climate change go further in terms of meeting the needs
of vulnerable members of society. As livelihood assets are perceived to be vulnerable to
climate change, there is a need to mainstream climate change adaptation into poverty
reduction programmes and integrating fisheries-specific needs into these. Increasing
fishers’ awareness of climate change and providing targeted assistance to cope up with
changes will help in ensuring the adaptive capacity of fishers.

INTRODUCTION
The Republic of Bangladesh’s fisheries sector supports the livelihoods of millions
of people and contributes significantly to GDP and nutrition. It is also considered
one of the most vulnerable sectors in a country that is highly vulnerable to climate
change impacts (Allison et al., 2009). The country has 64 districts with diversified
fisheries resources categorized into inland capture, inland culture and marine capture.
The degree of exposure to various climatic hazards and adaptive capacity is different
among districts. The major climatic shocks faced by the fishing communities of coastal
districts in the country are sea-level rise, salinity intrusion, cyclones and storm surges.
In addition, the fishing communities in the southwest and northwest regions are
particularly susceptible to drought (Shahid and Behrawan, 2008).
   A number of studies have investigated climate change impacts, vulnerability or
adaptation of fisheries at national or regional levels (e.g. Allison et al., 2009), and
other assumption-based studies or case studies have been conducted (e.g. Islam et al.,
2014a and b). However, to date no research has been conducted to measure the
district level vulnerability of fisheries to climate variability and change in the Republic
of Bangladesh. As such, the objective of this study was to measure the degree of
vulnerability of the fisheries sector to climate variability and change in 64 districts
using a composite vulnerability index approach and GIS.

METHODS
To measure district level vulnerability, this study first developed indicators for the
components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity), followed by
collection of indicator data and calculation of vulnerability. The exposure indicators
included: variation in historic maximum temperature (°C); variation in historic
minimum temperature (°C); future temperature projections (°C); variation in historic
rainfall (mm); future precipitation projections (% change); historic sea level change
(mm/year); historic land erosion; storm surge and cyclones. The sensitivity indicators
were fish production in overall fisheries and total water area used by fisheries. The
adaptive capacity indicators were poverty, GDP, literacy, access to electricity, housing
structure, household expenditure, road infrastructure, availability of primary school,
availability of secondary school, and access to clean water from tube-wells.
46   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




                Data on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were entered into the Statistical
             Package for Social Science (SPSS) data editor, and all variables were computed to get
             a standardized value (0 to 1) for each variable. The vulnerability of the fisheries sector
             was calculated as: vulnerability = [(exposure + sensitivity) – adaptive capacity]. The
             vulnerability values were also normalized (0 to 1). The normalized values for exposure,
             sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability were divided into four quartiles,
             where quartiles 1, 2, 3 and 4 were categorized as low, moderate, high and very high,
             respectively. These values were used to create exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity,
             and vulnerability maps by district using ArcMap 10.3.

             SUMMARY RESULTS
             A total of 21 climatic, environmental and socio-economic indicators were identified to
             reflect the three components of vulnerability; that is exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
             capacity. The results show that the very highly vulnerable districts (higher to lower
             order) in the fisheries sector are Sunamganj, Rangamati, Mymensingh, Lakshmipur,
             Shariatpur, Noakhali, Bhola and Kurigram (Figure 1). This vulnerability has emerged
             because of very high/high exposure, moderate sensitivity and low/moderate adaptive

capacity. The low vulnerability districts are Dhaka, Chittagong, Comilla and Gazipur.
Interestingly, the vulnerability of fisheries to climate change varies spatially in the
country with East Bengal, coastal districts, North Bengal, and districts adjacent to
rivers being highly vulnerable, whereas most divisional districts have low vulnerability
because of their low sensitivity and high/very high adaptive capacity. This study
concludes that inland areas are not always less vulnerable compared to coastal areas,
which challenges the commonly held notion.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This study has identified district-level vulnerabilities of fisheries in Bangladesh to
climate change. The findings will allow policymakers to easily identify the most
vulnerable districts and focus efforts to decrease this vulnerability and increase the
adaptive capacity. The Bangladesh government has allocated specific funding for
climate change mitigation and adaptation (e.g. Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund
(BCCTF) and Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF)). The aims of
these two funds are to reduce climate change vulnerability and increase resilience to
the adverse effects of climate change. Utilizing the findings of the study, policymakers
can easily identify where to target funding and effort to support the fisheries sector.
Moreover, other organizations, such as NGOs and donors, can also target their effort
toward the most vulnerable districts to reduce their vulnerability to climate change.
Finally, the very highly vulnerable districts can learn from the low vulnerability
districts about how to reduce their level of vulnerability.
   Although in the context of fisheries and climate change, this study has determined
the differential level of vulnerability in different districts in a rigorous way, the results
are not without issues. In some cases, deficiency of district level data was prominent,
and almost all of the organizations produce mostly national level data. Future studies
should use more district level data to determine the level of vulnerability.

Are climate change impacts
the cause of reduced fisheries
production in the African Great
Lakes region? The Lake Tanganyika
case study

INTRODUCTION
Reduced fisheries production in Africa’s Great Lakes region has been attributed to
human-induced changes to climate conditions. Temperature measurements on Lake
Tanganyika over a 100-year period show increases over time at different rates and at
different depths. Observed changes in wind patterns could also have caused variations
in upwelling intensity and frequency. At the same time, increasing human pressures,
including fishing effort, around the lake have contributed to accelerated nutrient
loading and pesticide/fertilizer run-off that has changed the lake’s water quality and
could be a factor influencing fisheries outputs. Estimates published in 2003 of climate
change impacts and the potential effect on primary (i.e. plankton) and secondary (fish)
production in Lake Tanganyika predict a 30 percent reduction in fish harvest without
taking into account the fishing capacity in the four countries that share the lake
resources (the Republic of Burundi, the United Republic of Tanzania, the Republic of
Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo). Consideration of increased fishing
effort and decreased fish harvest may also explain this reduction in harvest rather than
the rise in lake water temperature.
    Fish catches are critically important for the riparian countries of Lake Tanganyika with
consumption high and many communities depending on fisheries for their livelihoods.
In the 1990s, fish consumption in the Republic of Burundi was 6 kg/year per capita,
which declined to 2 kg/year in 2012. Declining fish catches and the disappearance of an
industrial fleet are the result of a rapid increase in artisanal fishing effort. The growth
in the artisanal fleet has been accompanied by improved efficiency using light attracting
devices, although artisanal fishers used lift-nets instead of purse seines. This paper
investigates whether declining harvests can be attributed to climate-induced changes
or overharvesting of Lake Tanganyika fisheries resources.

SUMMARY RESULTS
Lake Tanganyika Authority
The establishment of the Lake Tanganyika Authority (LTA) in 2009 led to the
resumption of fisheries management following a gap of about 10 years. One of the
functions of the LTA is to monitor fisheries production in the lake. To that end, a
lake-wide frame survey was conducted in 2011 and its results compared with an earlier
fisheries inventory in 1995 (Paffen, Coenen, Bambara, Wa Bazolana, Lyoma and
Lukwesa, 1995; LTA, 2012; Van der Knaap, Katonda and de Graaf, 2014).

                 From 1995 to 2011 the fishing capacity in terms of numbers of fishermen and canoes
             doubled, whereas the total annual fish harvest, which was estimated to be between
             165 000 and 200 000 tonnes in the 1990s (Mölsä, Reynolds, Coenen, and Lindquist,
             1999), decreased to between 110 000 and 120 000 tonnes in 2012. The latter result was
             obtained from a tailor-made data collection system, harmonized for the four nations
             bordering the lake, and based on the latest frame survey results. A full-year’s coverage
             was accomplished in the Republic of Burundi, the United Republic of Tanzania and the
             Republic of Zambia, and only a partial year was covered in the Democratic Republic
             of Congo.
                 The artisanal fisheries sector that particularly targets pelagic resources outcompeted
             the industrial sector over these 10 years. The industrial sector disappeared completely
             in the late 1990s in the Republic of Burundi and around 2010 in the Republic of Zambia
             as the number of artisanal fishing units continued to increase, leading to reduced catch
             rates by the industrial boats. The use of illegal fishing gear, such as beach seine and
             monofilament gillnets that do not discriminate between mature and immature fish, has
             also contributed to fish harvest decreases by reducing the stock below the maximum
             sustainable yield. In the Republic of Burundi, strengthened co-management activities
             had an immediate effect on the annual production in 2013 with a 15 percent increase in
             catch as compared to 2012 (unpublished data). It should be noted that natural variation
             in recruitment could also be the reason for the increase. Lake-wide harmonized
             co-management approaches and active enforcement of fishing regulations would
             likely contribute to the removal of illegal fishing gears, particularly beach seines and
             monofilament gillnets. It was expected that the LTA Secretariat would play a crucial
             role in this but political developments in one of the bordering countries since 2014
             made it difficult for the LTA Secretariat to have a positive impact on the lake’s fisheries
             management. The ongoing Tuungane Project, supported by The Nature Conservancy
             (TNC), contributes significantly to strengthened co-management in part of Tanzanian
             waters.
                 Another fishing activity that has adversely affected sustainable fisheries management
             is the collection of fish larvae, mainly clupeids, in the inshore waters of the Democratic
             Republic of Congo by women and children for food or to process it into dried fish
             cakes. Recent investigations indicate that the negative impact of this activity on the
             adult clupeid stocks is significant and should not be underestimated (Mulimbwa et al.,
             2018).

             Climate change or overfishing?
             The main question remains whether the reduction in secondary production (i.e. fish)
             is caused by climate change, overfishing or a combination of the two. However, this
             huge lake (with 17 percent of global fresh surface water) is likely to have a stabilizing
             effect on the regional (micro)climate, as suggested by various researchers (Langenberg,
             Sarvala and Roijackers, 2003).
                 Changes in wind patterns that have been observed should be monitored to determine
             if they are a result of global climate change or natural variation. An interesting example
             is the saba-saba (meaning “seven-seven” in Kiswahili), indicating a period of two weeks
             of stormy winds during which fishing and transport activities are seriously hampered
             by waves and strong winds. There are indications that this event, normally occurring in
             July, is shifting to other periods in the year. Such winds are directly linked to upwelling
             phenomena, which according to some limnologists are becoming less intensive because
             of stratification of the water column caused by warming. As a result, it is expected that
             primary production will decline, leading to reduced secondary pelagic production.
                 Changes in fish harvests may therefore be partially caused by climatic effects, but
             exacerbated by the increase in fishing capacity and effort on the lake by the artisanal
             sector. Despite the adoption of the FAO/LTA regional action plan to reduce the
Are climate change impacts the cause of reduced fisheries production in the African Great Lakes region?   51




fishing capacity on Lake Tanganyika in 2016 by the Conference of Ministers of the
LTA, the numbers of fishermen and canoes are still on the increase.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
This paper recommends that in addition to strengthened co-management, some form
of harmonized licensing system should be introduced in the four countries in order
to call a halt to the open-access character of the fishery that leads to overfishing, also
known as the “tragedy of the commons.” Such a system requires enforcement by a
combination of state and community interventions, which is not currently in place
among the riparian states.
   A number of development partners — the UN Food and Agriculture Organization,
World Bank/Global Environment Facility, the International Union for the Conservation
of Nature, the African Development Bank plus bilateral partners and universities —
accompanied the process of establishing the Lake Tanganyika Authority for many
years and conducted much research on the lake. In fact, with all the knowledge and
information obtained it has become clear what action is needed but financing stagnated
at a crucial point when important decisions needed to be made for the coming decades.
   Further monitoring of the fisheries and limnology, as well as meteorological
conditions is needed to identify the specific cause of declines in fish catches. Remote
sensing data can also be used to further study temperature distribution at the lake’s
surface and chlorophyll information. Such activities however, are not current
priorities for investment by the LTA or riparian governments. Lake Tanganyika
belongs to these countries, thus it is a responsibility of the four countries as well as
the international community to monitor and manage this important natural resource.
This paper highlights the problem of inland fisheries, in particular Lake Tanganyika,
which is crucial for livelihoods and food security for populations of the four countries
bordering the lake. Adaptation to climate-induced shifts in lake resources requires
improved fisheries management, including control of artisanal fishing fleets, as well as
good coordination among the countries that share the resource.

ABSTRACT
Climate change, a global challenge facing all humanity necessitates governments
to develop mitigation and adaptation plans. Climate change has multi-dimensional
impacts on environmental, fisheries, social, economic and development drivers. Marine
hot spots are defined regions that warm faster than the global average temperature.
Southwest India has been recognized as one of the 24 hotspot regions identified globally.
According to a study by Shyam et al. (2014a), the districts of Thiruvananthapuram and
Ernakulam are the most vulnerable villages in Kerala based on the vulnerability index
table formulated by using the method described by Patnaik and Narayin (2005). This
paper assessed the climate change vulnerability of over 800 fisher households in two
major fishing villages of Kerala viz., Elamkunnapuzha village of Ernakulam district
and Poonthura village of Thiruvananthapuram district, from the southwest hotspot
region of the Republic of India. The factors that determine vulnerability of households,
such as exposure (E), sensitivity (S) and adaptive capacity (AC), were captured using a
structured questionnaire and 198 indicators were identified. These comprised 36 related
to exposure, 37 indicators related to sensitivity, and 125 related to adaptive capacity,
and were used to construct vulnerability indices. The study revealed that the majority
of fisher households in both villages are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts
and are also unaware of climate change, which is a major cause of concern. The study
advocates the need for a bottom-up approach in developing location-specific plans to
ensure that the livelihoods of fishers and sustainable development of the fisheries sector
include the proactive participation of fishers.

INTRODUCTION
Climate change has been one of the most debated topics over the last few decades
and impacts are already being observed. Governments around the world are looking
for practical and time-bound plans to cope with the changing environment (Shyam
et al., 2014b). Climate change has multi-dimensional impacts on environmental,
fisheries, social, economic and development drivers (Shyam et al., 2015). Even though
the consequences of climate change are being experienced in both inland and coastal
regions, the coasts are the transition zone between land and sea and experience more
changes than other zones. However, climate change is not impacting all ocean regions
equally — with sea surface temperature warming faster in about 24 regions globally
54   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             above the average global rate of warming. Ocean warming “hotspots” are regions
             characterized by above-average temperature increases over recent years, for which there
             are significant consequences for both marine resources and the societies that depend on
             them (Popova et al., 2016, Hobday et al., 2016). As such, they represent early warning
             systems for understanding the impacts of marine climate change, and trial locations for
             developing adaptation options for coping with climate change impacts. Identification
             of these marine hotspots and the associated biological impacts suggests that coastal
             communities in these hotspot regions may be at higher risk compared to other regions.
                Kerala, one of the major coastal states, contributes about 16 percent of the
             total fish production of the country. The total marine fish landings in Kerala were
             estimated at 576 000 tonnes in 2014, registering a decline of 15 percent compared to
             the 671 000 tonnes landed in 2013 (CMFRI, 2015). According to global assessments
             of marine hotspot regions (Ridgway, 2007a; Cai et al., 2005; Cai, 2006), southern
             India is situated in a region that is predicted to warm substantially faster than the
             global average. As such, the impacts of climate change are expected to be observed
             and documented earlier in this region, making it a sentinel of climate impacts for other
             regions in the country as well as globally. Shyam et al., (2014b) reported low levels of
             climate change awareness among fisherfolk of Kerala owing to the fact that climate
             change causes and impacts are entangled with other developmental issues and the
             communities could not decipher climate change issues specifically. Hence the study
             supports advocating a bottom-up approach in developing location-specific plans with
             the proactive participation of fisherfolk.

             METHODS
             On the basis of historical observations of sea surface temperature, Hobday and Pecl
             (2014) identified 24 fast-warming marine areas or so-called “global hotspots”. They
             suggested that these hotspot regions could serve as “natural laboratories” where the
             mechanistic links between ocean warming and biological responses could be studied
             in advance of wider-scale impacts predicted for later in the 21st century. The marine
             area in the southwest of India has been recognized as one of the 24 hotspot regions
             identified globally. This study collected fisher data in two villages in southwest India in
             2014 using a multi-method approach. Exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity data
             were collected using structured household questionnaires. A simple random sampling
             technique was used to obtain information from fisher households. Participants
             were typically the household heads. When the household head was absent, another
             adult member of the household was interviewed. Local people from the respective
             communities (mostly educated and committed women and proactive college students)
             were selected as enumerators for the survey.
                In the initial part of the survey, focus group discussions were conducted with local
             government officials, officers from related departments and women self-help groups
             within the communities. Later, the officers from the local government of each district
             involved in the study identified local people for further training as enumerators, prior
             to the implementation of the survey. The selected enumerators were trained in topics
             covering climate change, vulnerability, exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity and
             resource management. They were also specifically trained in conducting household
             surveys with fishers. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at the household level,
             which took about 1 hour for each person. Exposure (E), sensitivity (S) and adaptive
             capacity (AC) are the key factors that determine the vulnerability of households to the
             impacts of climate variability and change (Hajkowicz, 2006; IPCC, 2007; Islam et al.,
             2014; Johnson et al., 2016) and were the focus of data collected using the household
             questionnaire.
                The aim of this study was to identify the extent of vulnerability and the component
             structure of the vulnerability category measured using a Likert-type response scale and
Climate change impacts on livelihood vulnerability assessment                                55




to summarize the data into one or more sub-scales of vulnerability category that can be
used for further models. Based on the availability of data, 198 indicators were used in
the construction of the vulnerability indices, that is 36 indicators related to exposure,
37 related to sensitivity, and 125 related to adaptive capacity. A composite vulnerability
index approach (Patnaik and Narayin, 2005) was used to evaluate relative exposure,
sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The study quantitatively assessed the vulnerability
of fishery-based livelihood systems using the combination of individual indicators.
Since each indicator was measured on a different scale, they were normalized (rescaled
from 0 to 1). After normalization, the values were transformed into a four-point scale,
categorized as 0—0.25, 0.26—50, 0.60—0.75 and 0.76—1.00 which were assigned score
values 1 (low), 2 (medium), 3 (high) and 4 (very high), respectively. These values were
averaged to yield the three sub-indices for exposure (E), sensitivity (S) and adaptive
capacity (AC) to ultimately calculate vulnerability (V). Sub-indices were combined
to create a composite vulnerability index by using the following additive (averaging)
equation: V=E+S-AC.

SUMMARY RESULTS
The overall vulnerability of the villages was assessed and the analysis revealed that
Poonthura fishing village of Kerala has a higher vulnerability when compared to
Elamkunnapuzha fishing village. The results also revealed that the majority of the
fisher population in both the villages were highly vulnerable to climate change, which is
a major cause of concern. Fishery-based livelihoods in households of Elamkunnapuzha
and Poonthura have high exposure to climate-related shocks and stresses because the
communities are located near the coastline. Even though both the study villages were
found to experience similar vulnerability shocks, Poonthura village is more vulnerable
compared to Elamkunnapuzha (Shyam et al., 2017). The proximity of Poonthura
village to the sea was attributed as the major factor driving high vulnerability
compared to Elamkunnapuzha. In addition, higher exposure to environmental changes,
occurrence of drought and shoreline changes also contributed to higher vulnerability
in Poonthura. The vulnerability index of Poonthura was calculated to be 2.85 whereas
that of Elamkunnapuzha was 2.80. Even though the adaptive capacity indices of both
villages were similar (2.57 and 2.52 for Elamkunnapuzha and Poonthura, respectively),
considerable variation was found in exposure (2.67 and 2.80 for Elamkunnapuzha and
Poonthura, respectively) and sensitivity indices (2.70 and 2.57 for Elamkunnapuzha and
Poonthura, respectively), which may explain the variation in the overall vulnerability
of the two fishing villages.
    One of the major findings of the study is that the majority of respondents from
both the study villages are unaware of climate change. The respondents admitted that
they are experiencing changes with respect to their fisheries and the environment,
but don’t understand the reason. According to respondents, the depletion of fisheries
resources as well as natural disasters in the area are because of overfishing by foreign
vessels and other human activities, such as marine pollution, illegal fishing activities,
and juvenile fishing. Exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity influence the
vulnerability of fishery-based livelihoods in a variety of ways. An understanding of
how these components and indicators influence the overall vulnerability of livelihoods
provides an important basis for directing future research and climate change coping
and adaptation strategies in developing countries, particularly those with small-scale
fisheries that are similar to those of Kerala in southern India.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Vulnerability to climate change varies between places, communities, and social classes.
The contextual nature of livelihood vulnerability and considerations of spatial and
temporal scale make it challenging to develop robust indicators. The selection of
56   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             indicators often involves a trade-off between specificity, transferability, accuracy, and
             certainty (Vincent, 2007). In the future, the vulnerability of fishery-based livelihoods
             may markedly increase because of climate change. In the absence of adaptation,
             increased frequency and intensity of storms and floods could result in greater loss of
             life at sea and in the coastal zone, greater damage to fishing gears and household assets,
             and a loss of fishery related income. If sea-level rise accelerates as projected during
             this century, coastal areas of the Republic of India will also experience inundation and
             accelerated erosion in coastal communities. Future livelihood vulnerability is closely
             linked with technological, demographic, and socio-economic trends and how these
             factors influence the ability of fisheries-dependent households and communities to
             adapt. This study advocates the need for a bottom-up approach in developing location-
             specific plans to ensure that the livelihood of fishers and sustainable development of the
             fisheries sector include proactive participation by fishers. In the meantime, awareness
             campaigns are needed, as communities are unaware of climate change implications
             for their resources. Proper adaptation-mitigation strategies should be developed and
             implemented to minimize the adverse impacts of climate change.

INTRODUCTION
Fishing communities from developing countries are often more vulnerable to
environmental and climate changes and variability because of their lack of adaptive
capacity. The capacity to adapt depends on a number of social, economic, technical and
physical factors, and high vulnerability persists because of lack of financial and technical
support for modernization, insufficient knowledge of marketing and irregularity
in subsidies. However, not all communities are vulnerable to the same degree, with
small-scale fisheries that are highly dependent on traditional ways of fishing being
more vulnerable than others (Senapati and Gupta, 2017). Furthermore, increases in
economic activities near the coast place additional pressures on fisher communities
(McGranahan et al., 2007). These changes have resulted in declines in fish availability,
migration of fish species, and reduced access to particular target species (Coulthard,
2010; Badjeck et al., 2008). This research provides a case study of the vulnerability and
adaptation of fisher communities living in Mumbai, the Republic of India (Figure 1),

             known as Koli communities. Koli communities are the earliest inhabitants of the city,
             however their livelihoods are now threatened by irregular rainfall, changes in wind
             patterns and changing ocean currents. Floods and rising sea level are also threatening
             the communities and making it difficult to sustain their livelihoods through fishing.

             SUMMARY RESULTS
             The fisheries-dependent population in Mumbai is exposed to significant environmental,
             climate and socio-economic pressures. The socio-economic implications of climate
             change on fisheries livelihoods were assessed using a primary survey of 182 fisher
             families from five fishing villages (Khardanda, Madh, Mahim, Versova, and Worli as
             shown in Figure 1) known as “Koliwada” in Mumbai. A total of 30 indicators were
             selected for the study using the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) (Ekin and
             Tapia, 2008) and multicriteria analysis (MCA) (Satty, 2008) to select indicators and to
             allocate weightings to the selected indicators (Senapati and Gupta, 2017). Vulnerability
             indicators were selected for sensitivity/exposure (Table 1) and adaptive capacity
             (Table 2).

                The sensitivity/exposure indicators were divided into two categories: livelihood
             and perceived changes. Similarly, the indicators for adaptive capacity were grouped
             into five categories comprising the five capitals: human, physical, financial, social and
             governance (Smith and Wandel, 2006; Ekin and Tapia, 2008; Senapati and Gupta, 2017).

                 The study used primary data obtained through household surveys for deriving
             vulnerability scores. The data collected through the primary surveys were standardized
             using value functions (Beinat, 1997). The indicator scores were calculated by applying
             a simple indexing non-weighted method and comparing survey data with expert scores
             derived through MCA (for details see Senapati and Gupta, 2017). The vulnerability

scores for “physical capital” and “financial capital” differ among villages, demonstrating
varying adaptive capacity between these villages (Figure 2). Madh village was found to
be the most vulnerable because of its high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity scores,
and Worli village was the second most vulnerable community.

allowing these fishers to alter their

have greater access to climate information and are more aware of climate change, so
they can change their practices to more intensive fishing for two to three months,
hence maximizing their catches, although this method raises issues about fisheries
sustainability. To assist fisheries that have low adaptive capacity, local governments
need to develop strong policies that support small-scale fishers, such as restricting
mechanized boats in nearshore areas, enforcing larger net sizes, providing subsidies and
providing training to small-scale fishers to target new varieties of fish.

ABSTRACT
Traditionally, small island communities around the world have had a strong association
with their marine resources, depending on small-scale fisheries for food security,
livelihoods, cultural practices and economic and rural development. This reliance on
marine resources stems from having access to large ocean areas and therefore small
islands are often described as “large ocean states”. They include island nations as well
as islands that are part of larger mainland nations, for example, Hawaii (United States of
America), Torres Strait (Australia), São Sebastião, Fernando de Noronha and Trindade
and Martim Vaz (Brazil), and the islands of Kerala (the Republic of India). Despite
this heterogeneity, small islands share similar socio-ecological characteristics that make
them highly vulnerable to climate variability and change and, as a consequence, many
of their marine resources are projected to decline. Although climate impacts on small
islands are rarely recognized in global assessments, the effects of climate variability
and change are expected to have critical consequences by decreasing small-scale coastal
fisheries production, directly impacting fisheries livelihoods and infrastructure and
exacerbating other pressures that are a function of their relative isolation, generally
small economies and limited access to markets. To maintain the contributions of
small-scale fisheries to sustainable social and economic development in the face of
climate change, practical adaptations are needed that suit the specific socio-ecological
characteristics and challenges of small islands, which by their nature, can both help
and hinder adaptation. Collectively, key lessons from successful adaptations can help
to identify the suite of options most appropriate to small islands and their fisheries.
These lessons can also guide international and regional initiatives and investment to
address the specific needs of small islands and provide practical solutions that support
the adaptation of small-scale fisheries.

             future change (e.g. Johnson and Welch, 2016; Monnereau et al., 2017). Small islands
             share similar sustainability challenges related to specific characteristics including their
             small size, relative isolation, susceptibility to extreme events, vulnerability to external
             economic and political shocks, coastal concentration of population and infrastructure,
             high level of endemic species, high dependence on marine resources, and significant
             dependence on international trade (Mimura et al., 2007; Guillotreau et al., 2012; Nurse
             et al., 2014; Polido et al., 2014). As a result, small islands are expected not only to
             be most at risk from climate change (Nurse et al. 2014) but also the “first adopters”
             of adaptations, providing lessons for actions elsewhere (Betzold, 2015). The direct
             and indirect impacts of climate change and variability on marine capture fisheries is
             of increasing concern (Brander, 2010; Cheung et al., 2010; Mora, 2013), particularly
             for small island states (Nurse, 2011; Bell et al., 2015a), with biophysical and socio-
             economic impacts expected (Allison et al., 2009; Johnson and Welch, 2010; Nurse,
             2011; Pörtner et al., 2014; Welch et al., 2014; Bell et al., forthcoming). Critically, climate
             impacts will exacerbate unprecedented challenges marine ecosystems already face as a
             result of inter alia fisheries overexploitation, pollution of coastal waters (e.g. sewage
             and agricultural runoff), illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, invasive species,
             habitat destruction, and coastal erosion.
                 These cumulative pressures are particularly detrimental to small islands fisheries
             that depend so heavily on the marine resources from their large ocean areas and it is
             therefore not surprising that these “large ocean states” are considered highly vulnerable
             to climate change (e.g. UN-OHRLLS, UNESCO, UN-DOALOS, 2014; Johnson
             et al., 2017). For example, in the tropical Pacific island region there are 22 national
             Exclusive Economic Zones that cover 27 million km2 and only 2 percent of the area is
             land. As a result, these large ocean states are critically dependent on marine ecosystems;
             consuming fish at 98–147 kg/person/year (3–5 times the global average), sourcing
             50–90 percent of their protein from reef fisheries (in rural communities), and providing
             47 percent of coastal households their first or second income from small-scale reef
             fisheries (Bell et al., 2011 and forthcoming).
                 Adaptation of fisheries to climate change impacts on small islands is often limited
             by their remoteness, insufficient human and financial capital, and high dependence on
             marine resources. This underscores the difficulty small islands face in effectively adapting
             to climate change when facing barriers in perceptions and awareness, institutions,
             and (lack of) resources (Betzold, 2015). However, there is a wide range in capacity
             for effective marine resource management and challenges in fostering development
             depending, in part, on whether islands are nation states or territories. Many small
             islands have proposed and critiqued diverse policy and practice responses to climate
             change, from human migration, hard and soft engineering options, mainstreaming of
             climate change into natural resource policies and regulations, and societal changes,
             with an emphasis on integration with sustainable development planning (e.g. SAMOA
             Pathway, 2014). How these changes will be implemented and their ultimate success in
             minimizing climate impacts on small island fisheries and communities remains unclear.
                 Although attention on the unique challenges faced by small island states because of
             climate change and their social construct is gaining momentum, inadequacies in data,
             and in institutional and local capacity remain major problems. This is especially true
             for the world’s most impoverished and vulnerable small island communities, which
             paradoxically are frequently neglected or under-represented even in research about
             small island climate change impacts and adaptation (Monnereau et al., 2017). It is
             clear that for future adaptation on small islands to be effective and sustainable, these
             challenges need to be overcome, in particular by providing information, capacity and
             resources at the local level through targeted support (Betzold, 2015).
                 This paper explores how small-scale fisheries on small islands are both vulnerable
             and resilient to the impacts of climate change. It identifies practical adaptations specific

to small islands that assist small-scale fisheries to cope with projected climate change
and continue to provide food and livelihoods for coastal communities. The paper aims
to highlight the challenges that small islands face in confronting climate change, and
provide lessons for practical adaptations that are relevant to other small-scale fisheries
and locations. It is hoped that this will facilitate implementation of relevant and
effective climate change adaptations in small islands to maintain ecological and social
well-being.

ADAPTATION OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES ON SMALL ISLANDS TO CLIMATE
CHANGE
Key adaptations for small-scale fisheries on island states must focus on minimizing
exposure and sensitivity to climate change impacts, and maximizing adaptive capacity.
Since most small island communities focus their fishing effort close to the coast in
nearshore habitats, adaptation interventions need to focus on these locations and the
practices therein. Increasingly it is recognized that destructive fishing and overfishing
of coastal marine resources is occurring on small islands (as in other locations)
primarily because of rapidly increasing human populations (Sale et al., 2014) coupled
with limited local capacity for effective fisheries management (e.g. Gillett et al., 2014).
Together, these are increasing the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to climate
change. Climate-informed, ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management that
incorporate community awareness of the effects of changing climate on coastal fish
stocks and habitats are required. Therefore, actions to use coastal fish and invertebrates
sustainably in the face of a changing climate are key to minimizing vulnerability
and supporting adaptation (Bell et al., 2015a,b, forthcoming; Johnson et al., 2016).
Most critical, however, is the need to support responsible fisheries transitions (e.g.
to different species, gears, techniques) with alternative protein and income sources as
small island states have limited options when harvest controls increase.
   As well as sustainably managing harvest levels, adaptation success will depend
on disaster response management that reduces exposure of small-scale fisheries,
increasing awareness and knowledge of climate change impacts on the sector. Action
must minimize direct impacts on island communities (e.g. reinforcing natural coastal
barriers, supporting changes to post-harvest practices, and early warning systems), and
mainstream climate change into fisheries policies, plans and legislation. Importantly,
improving the capacity of fisherfolk and aquaculturists to adapt will rely on customary
marine tenure and other institutions of social capital, local governance, traditional
knowledge, and self-enforcement capacity to provide the most effective way forward
(Heenan et al., 2015). Although many of these adaptations are largely about improving
current practices and implementing best practices (e.g. “no regrets actions”), specific
climate change information should be incorporated to target key areas of vulnerability
for small island states (e.g. Johnson et al., 2013).

Climate-aware coastal fisheries management: Climate-aware ecosystem approaches
to fisheries management is critical to ensure sustainable production of coastal fish
and invertebrates in small island communities where scientific catch monitoring
and stock status analysis are not possible (Cochrane et al., 2011; McClanahan et al.,
2014; Heenan et al., 2015). Although fisheries management will need to incorporate
observed and expected changes that are the result of climate change, for many small
island states the adoption of basic fisheries management measures alone represent a
key climate change adaptation. For example, decreasing fish sizes, changing species
composition or distribution, and altered spawning (spatial or temporal) are some of
the predicted climate change impacts, however these impacts are already widespread
because of overfishing. Therefore, “primary” fisheries measures will have to be applied
in a flexible and conservative manner because of the uncertainty of long-term climate
68   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




            change; this will support stocks’ replenishment potential over the longer term and
            increase resilience to future impacts (Hobday et al., 2008; Madin et al., 2012).
               Primary fisheries management employs simple harvest controls (e.g. size limits,
            gear restrictions) thus limiting the local supply of fish and invertebrates in the short-
            term (Cochrane et al., 2011). Addressing this shortfall through alternatives will be
            essential to support adaptation. Monnereau and Oxenford (2017) examined the bio-
            ecological and socio-economic changes that can be expected for the four main fisheries
            in the Caribbean region and found that community-based approaches that incorporate
            extensive local consultation, co-management and education can foster the necessary
            cultural and attitudinal change. This will be key to the successful implementation of
            climate-aware fisheries management approaches in small island states.

            Minimize degradation of coastal habitats: Coastal fish habitats are already impacted by
            current activities, and protecting them by prohibiting destructive activities will maintain
            habitat condition in the short-term and build their resilience to future climate change in
            the long-term (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2011; Waycott et al.; 2011) thereby supporting
            sustainable fisheries. Actions are needed that prohibit or minimize: (1) sewage, chemical
            and waste pollution; (2) activities that physically damage the structure and function of
            habitats, such as destructive fishing practices, careless boating practices, and poorly-
            designed coastal infrastructure and tourist facilities; and (3) extractive activities, for
            example mining sand or coral for building materials, harvesting mangroves for timber
            or charcoal, and dredging of channels.

            Appropriately designed spatial management: Ensuring that small island states create
            areas of sufficient size to help protect spawning biomass for replenishment of coastal
            fish stocks and to conserve biodiversity is required (Rice et al., 2012). These areas
            need to be designed to take account of the ecology of target fish species (Green et al.,
            2014), e.g. sequential use of different habitats (Nagelkerken et al., 2000; Sheaves
            et al., 2006), and the dependence of species on structurally complex habitats (Rogers
            et al., 2014). Mosaics of these habitats likely to persist under climate change will need
            to be protected so that connectivity is maintained between habitats for successful
            recruitment of juvenile fish and invertebrates, and to provide a diverse range of feeding
            areas for adult fish (Bell et al., forthcoming). Well-designed protected area networks
            have the potential to increase the resistance of habitats to future climate change (Mellin
            et al., 2016), and when applied flexibly can allow for cooperative trading of access
            after natural disturbances or other impacts on fish stocks (e.g. cyclones/hurricanes)
            to improve food security. Flexible mechanisms are needed to allow for change and
            ensure adaptive management, such as institutional instruments that initiate a review or
            alternative spatial rules based on a set of pre-agreed criteria, such as declines in habitat
            condition or increasing human use. Fishers in the Grenadines islands have proposed
            this since their marine protected areas are very small and their effectiveness relies on
            a connected network of areas and optimized access for all users.

            Diversify catches of coastal fisheries: Climate change is expected to alter the structure
            of local fish assemblages because of changes in species’ distributions (Cheung et al.,
            2010) and the structure of coastal habitats (Pratchett et al., 2008 and 2011, Hoegh-
            Guldberg et al., 2011). Transferring fishing effort from species projected to be most
            impacted by climate change to those species expected to be least impacted (e.g. those
            predicted to increase in local abundance) or that are more resilient to environmental
            change (e.g. higher productivity species), can help to maintain the overall catch of
            fish. For example, small pelagic fish (mackerel, anchovies, pilchards, sardines, scads
            and fusiliers) are generally resilient to high levels of fishing and currently provide
            a seasonal bait and/or food resource in many small island regions. Targeting these
Climate change adaptation: vulnerability and challenges facing small-scale fisheries on small islands   69




species provides an alternative catch for small-scale fishers (Pratchett et al., 2011;
Roeger et al., 2016) but only if any new fisheries implement sustainable ecosystem-
based management to account for climate sensitivities and prevent overfishing,
particularly given the role of such species in linking ecosystem function and energy
transfer (Pikitch et al., 2012). In applying such an adaptation, attention should be
placed on limiting the harvest of species with important ecological functions, for
example herbivorous fish (Bozec et al., 2013) and apex predators) and/or those that are
most vulnerable to overfishing (Graham et al., 2010).

Improve fish handling and shelf life of fish catches: An important consideration
for small island communities is the variability of catch rates between seasons and
years, and wastage because of poor fish handling and/or preservation; issues that
are predicted to be exacerbated by climate change. Improving food safety and fish
handling from the fisher up the chain to distributors will reduce fish waste and
improve the availability of fish for food to households. Improving the ability of
households to store fish for those times when conditions are not suitable for fishing or
as fish assemblages and conditions change because of climate change, is an important
adaptation that can use and improve on traditional methods for smoking, salting and
drying fish. Improved preservation methods can also create new opportunities to trade
or sell seafood products, particularly in large island nations, such as the Independent
State of Papua New Guinea and the Republic of Cuba, that have inland communities
without access to fish. Programmes that reinvigorate traditional smoking, drying
(including solar dryers) and storage techniques can reduce local loss and waste, and
additional support can introduce new facilities for alternative post-harvest practices,
such as vacuum-sealing or freezing seafood thus supplying products for export to
high-end markets and institutional customers (e.g. government schools). Coupled with
sustainable fisheries management, this approach can add value to catches and improve
economic benefits and job opportunities for fishing communities, especially women
(e.g. Sumagaysay, 2017 in this volume).

Increased use of aquaculture: Aquaculture has become increasingly important in
meeting natural marine resource deficits and is trying to meet the increasing demand
for fish in domestic and international markets because of lifestyle and economic factors.
Aquaculture could allow for more control over the production environment, reducing
communities’ risks to environmental factors. Therefore, aquaculture presents an
opportunity to assist small islands in terms of food security, employment and foreign
exchange earnings, yet it is still underdeveloped and faces its own climate risks and
opportunities that will require focused adaptation planning. For example, aquaculture
planning would need to consider challenges in terms of the need for fresh water, which
is often scarce on small islands, and electricity that is usually expensive, unreliable
and vulnerable to extreme weather events. Climate-sensitive aquaculture would need
to incorporate designs that make very efficient use of scarce water resources (e.g.
aquaponics, which uses a recirculation system) and energy efficient or self-generation
options, such as solar panels.

Education, awareness and capacity building: Small island states tend to be
overwhelmingly limited in resources and capacity and therefore require significant
support for implementation of adaptation options. Fundamental climate awareness,
particularly how climate change and variability will impact the sector, is critical to
enable informed adaptation. When coupled with associated capacity building and
education, such as on the impacts of increasing human population on the availability of
fish for food (Bell et al., forthcoming) and technical skills, this awareness can engender
change and facilitate effective adaptation in small island states. Comprehensive
70   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             communication, education and public awareness programmes should be prepared
             for targeting a variety of audiences, primarily focusing on fisherfolk, aquaculturists,
             fisherfolk associations and fishing communities to increase support for and ownership
             of adaptation actions. The key to underpinning this and all adaptation initiatives is
             the need to support the necessary capacity for implementation and governance of
             management systems.
                Adaptations that depend on specific local circumstances and conditions are not
             discussed here, but include: scaling-up marketing and distribution to increase access
             to small-scale fisheries products in rural and remote locations; developing specialty
             (niche) products for access to high-value markets (e.g. eco-certified seafood); enhancing
             access to finance, technology and markets through the use of regional collectives and
             cooperative mechanisms; and improving early warning systems, preparation and fishing
             practices in response to projected climate change effects on fishing infrastructure and
             communities, fisheries catches and safety at sea.

             INCREASING REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL AWARENESS OF AND SUPPORT
             FOR ADAPTATION
             Small island states have been one of the first areas affected by climate change and are
             therefore the first places where adaptation is required (Betzold, 2015). The United Nations
             Development Programme (UNDP) has supported a substantial number of climate change
             adaptation projects in small island developing states (SIDS) across a number of different
             thematic areas (UNDP, 2017). Over 100 SIDS projects received support on climate change
             adaptation and mitigation through the UNDP-GEF Green Low Emission Climate
             Resilient Development Strategies team, and a similar number of initiatives received
             support from the UNDP-GEF Ecosystems and Biodiversity team. An additional 18
             projects supported by the UNDP-GEF Water and Oceans team were specifically funded
             to focus on sustainable fisheries in SIDS. Other groups, such as the Adaptation Fund,
             Green Climate Fund, Least Developed Countries Fund and Pilot Programme for Climate
             Resilience allocated over USD 1 085 million to SIDS between 2003 and 2016 to finance
             187 projects in 38 countries (Table 1) (Overseas Development Institute, 2016). In spite of
             this, climate change adaptation remains poorly funded at less than 7 percent of all global
             climate finance and fulfills only a small portion of the actual need.

Climate change adaptation: vulnerability and challenges facing small-scale fisheries on small islands   71




   Whereas the adaptation projects discussed above have begun to address the
complex challenges posed by climate change, demonstrated tools and approaches
that focus specifically on small island communities are not common. In spite of the
obvious impacts of climate change on small-scale coastal fisheries and other key
resources in small islands, there is limited current investment in adaptation. There
is also little agreement on the factors needed to support local scale adaptation or
guidance on how adaption should proceed (McLeod et al., 2015). Community-based
(bottom-up) adaptation (Reid et al., 2009) has emerged as an important part of the
response to this need and an increasing number of case studies are emerging that
focus on the development of adaptation tools and the application of locally relevant
data collection methods. This includes examples in the Coral Triangle where social
learning, networking and empowerment was found to support community adaptation
efforts (Butler et al., 2016); community-based adaptation actions that emphasise
local knowledge to complement and validate scientific data at appropriate spatial and
temporal scales (Leon, 2016); and integrated multi-sector planning efforts that seek
to enhance community benefits (Wongbusarakum et al., 2015). These local studies
support the overall development of adaptation tools, improve the prioritization,
funding, and completion of adaptation projects in small island communities, and
support an understanding of how climate change impacts on small island communities
and associated fisheries can be best addressed.
   Several consultative processes are underway globally to amplify the voices of
small-scale fisheries in the international forums associated with bringing Sustainable
Development Goal SDG 14 (Life Below Water) to the attention of policymakers.
SDG 14 includes a target and indicators specifically about small-scale fisheries, and
the Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC AR5) noted the high vulnerability of small-scale fisheries
and coastal populations, thus they remain a focus through these linked initiatives.
Adaptation to climate change and variability is one of the areas in which fisherfolk,
such as the Caribbean Network of Fisherfolk Organizations (CNFO), advocate
that more resources should be allocated. Such additional resources, if linked to the
implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale
Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (FAO, 2015),
could be aimed at strengthening fisherfolk self-organization and leadership through
experiential learning rather than exacerbating dependence on external subsidies or
inputs and initiating additional studies that are devoid of practical adaptation.


                                          CASE STUDY 1
                                         Caribbean region
   The Caribbean has a high number of small island states that are among the 17
   member states of the advisory regional fisheries body known as the Caribbean
   Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM) in which all countries have small-scale
   fisheries (Haughton et al., 2004). The CRFM, along with several other state and
   non-state fisheries, climate and disaster organizations, operates within the large area
   of the FAO Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC). To achieve
   bottom-up inputs into regional and international fisheries policy and practice, the
   fisherfolk organizations in CRFM countries formed the still-growing Caribbean
   Network of Fisherfolk Organizations (CNFO) (McConney and Phillips, 2011). This
   fisherfolk network is becoming a civil society leader, regionally and internationally,
   in fisheries climate change adaptation initiatives within the implementation of an
   ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the Voluntary Guidelines for
   Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and
   Poverty Eradication (FAO, 2015).
72   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




                CASE STUDY 1 (CONTINUED)

                Through collective action, the CNFO is informing and influencing regional and
                international climate change adaptation projects and programmes that address matters
                as diverse as fisheries governance, gear and vessel technology, physical infrastructure,
                livelihoods, leadership, gender, implementation of ecosystem approaches, information
                and communication technology, and more. In so doing, the CNFO is increasing
                awareness and support for adaptation via collaborative fieldwork at sea level through
                to high-level conferences at the FAO, all with a practical focus on small-scale, small
                island fisheries (McConney et al., 2016). The model of the CNFO civil society
                collaboration with several state and non-state actors, including academia, in pursuing
                its goals to improve the well-being of fisherfolk offers lessons for other regions and
                stakeholders that wish to engage at multiple levels with the juggernaut of international
                climate change negotiations and initiatives, but prefer not to do so single-handedly.




             SUPPORTING POLICIES
             In order for climate change adaptations on small islands to be successful, policies
             that mainstream climate change adaptation, allow for inevitable change, and promote
             the implementation of specific adaptation actions to address key vulnerabilities
             are essential (McConney et al., 2015). Implementing policies based on the range of
             topics covered by the SSF Guidelines (FAO, 2015) is important; and engagement of
             the fisheries and aquaculture sectors will be critical. Disaster risk assessments and
             management at the local scale assist community preparedness, but it is imperative that
             the specific characteristics of the fisheries and aquaculture sector are clearly understood
             from technical, social and economic points of view (Westlund et al., 2007). Policies
             that support responsible fisheries, human rights and sustainable social and economic
             development with an emphasis on small-scale fishers, fish workers, and vulnerable
             populations are recommended.
                Responsible governance of small-scale fisheries and aquaculture is critical and can
             support sustainable development goals (SDGs). Fisherfolk and fisheries authorities
             in many small island states have advocated strengthening regional and national
             marine resource governance, policies, programmes, plans and legislation to ensure
             that the fisheries sector is included in National Action Plans (NAPs), and that climate
             and disaster responses are integrated into fisheries management plans based on an
             ecosystem approach to fisheries management (McConney et al., 2015; SPC, 2015).
             A major initiative in the Caribbean in this direction is the Ten-year Strategic Action
             Programme agreed to by over 20 countries in the Wider Caribbean. The Programme
             aims to improve transboundary governance of shared living marine resources in the
             areas of the Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems (the CLME+
             region). Multi-level policy cycles are being designed, tested and strengthened to address
             issues that include fisheries and climate in the CLME+ region, where small islands
             predominate (Mahon et al., 2014). Important institutional arrangements within this
             programme are national inter-sectoral consultative mechanisms. These mechanisms,
             which can range from powerful sustainable development commissions to small
             fisheries advisory committees, all serve the purpose of bringing attention to the efforts
             of small-scale fisheries to engage in adaptation across sectors. For example, tourism can
             seldom be separated from fisheries in the Caribbean islands in terms of coastal space
             use and economic interactions. These sectors need to adapt collaboratively to climate
             change for optimal benefits. Policies and projects that promote marine spatial planning
             are among those that support inter-sectoral climate change adaptation initiatives, and
             are also favoured by environmental interests (McConney at al., 2014).
Climate change adaptation: vulnerability and challenges facing small-scale fisheries on small islands   73




    Although evidence supports the premise that declining coastal fish resources can be
attributed to climate change impacts, given the lack of resource management in many
small island states, it is certain that this is also caused by overfishing as a result of
increasing population growth and demand for food. Primary fisheries management has
been identified as the key to the success of small-scale fishery adaptation efforts. Many
small island states have a tradition of using customary management practices (e.g. taboo
areas or no fishing zones), however with increasing cumulative impacts driven largely
by increasing human population, effective management to maximize resilience will
require national intervention and coordination. Therefore, any adaptation efforts to
mitigate future impacts on coastal resources must be complemented with robust and
effective primary fisheries management legislation. Successfully implementing such
legislation will require support for fisheries transitions (to different gears, techniques
and species). Market assessments of value adding in the fish chain, skills training, and
collaboration between harvest and post-harvest fisherfolk can support the transition to
alternative techniques and (underutilized) species. For example, fisherfolk in Barbados
have marketed less familiar species by selling them to consumers as fillets so they are
not surprised by the appearance but still they are being offered a high quality semi-
processed product.
    The revision of national and regional policies and plans to reduce climate and non-
climate impacts on small-scale fisheries and initiatives to prioritize their contribution to
food security and livelihoods are critical on small islands (e.g. McConney et al., 2015;
Bell et al., 2015a and forthcoming). Pressures on small-scale fisheries that originate
upstream, e.g. terrestrial pollutant runoff, urbanization and changes to river flow
regimes because of dams and irrigation, can have significant direct impacts on coastal
habitats and fisheries (Waycott et al., 2011; Pratchett et al., 2011) as well as exacerbate
climate impacts (Heenan et al., 2015). For example, climate change adaptations in
watersheds aimed at other sectors, such as agriculture, and urban centres, can negatively
impact small-scale fisheries downstream if additional water extraction for irrigation,
dams or the development of hydropower significantly alter river and estuarine flows.
Therefore, an integrated and holistic approach through national and regional policies
is essential to ensure future sustainability of small-scale fisheries (Aswani and Ruddle,
2013; Sale et al., 2014). Such approaches must address land-based pollution sources, as
well as other local and global pressures, such as marine-based pollution, overfishing,
and destructive and illegal fishing practices.


                                   CASE STUDY 2
               Addressing non-climate impacts on coastal fisheries in Fiji
   The small land area of the Pacific island states has resulted in historically high
   levels of clearing and land-use change that have downstream impacts on coastal
   habitats and fisheries. Sustaining coastal fish production therefore depends on
   effective coastal fisheries management as well as good land-management practices to
   maintain coastal water quality and habitats (Foley et al., 2005; Wilkinson and Brodie,
   2011; Koshiba et al., 2014). In the Republic of Fiji, the development of Integrated
   Catchment Management Plans for select watersheds on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu
   aim to reduce the negative impacts of land-based activities on coastal habitats and
   species. The plans focus on mangrove protection, the adoption of sustainable land use
   practices and riparian restoration in adjoining upstream watersheds, and restoration
   and rehabilitation of forests. These initiatives will also contribute to Fiji’s REDD+
   (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) strategy through
   an increase in forest carbon stocks and mitigation of climate change.
74   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




                 Supporting policies that addresses direct climate impacts are also critical, and the
             climate and disaster provisions in the SSF Guidelines (FAO, 2015) are of particular
             interest to fisherfolk. They have engaged in influencing policies so that they incorporate
             more fisheries perspectives in regional climate arrangements that have been endorsed
             at the highest ministerial levels (McConney et al., 2015). Such influence is intended to
             mobilize resources beyond those normally allocated to small-scale fisheries on small
             islands. Climate change adaptation provides the leverage required to obtain additional
             resources.


                                                 CASE STUDY 3
                          Incorporating climate change into Caribbean fisheries policy
               In the Caribbean, the CNFO is advocating a protocol to the Caribbean Community
               Common Fisheries Policy that incorporates the SSF Guidelines (FAO, 2015).
               Fisherfolk are aiming for the protocol to be formulated by a small partnership
               of organizations willing to collaborate with the CNFO as part of their network
               approach to developing adaptive capacity (McConney et al., 2011).
                  Conversely, many small island states have made slow progress with policies
               incorporating and addressing climate change in a meaningful way, and further
               assistance and support is required to mainstream climate change into legislation.




             CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             Climate change impacts have been identified as a major threat to small island
             fisheries, particularly in the tropics (Bell et al., forthcoming; Johnson and Welch,
             2016; Monnereau et al., 2017). These small island fisheries are particularly vulnerable
             because they are highly exposed to climate-related impacts, experience other impacts
             associated with over-exploitation of resources, pollution and urbanization, and in
             many cases have limited alternatives for food and income. Further, their resilience tends
             to be compromised because of a lack of effective management, and in many cases no
             management. Small islands have limited land area and generally large ocean areas, and
             as a result tend to be geographically remote, isolated from global markets, have a high
             dependence on marine resources, are vulnerable to external economic and political
             shocks, and generally have small economies based on tourism and/or service delivery
             rather than production.
                Small-scale fisheries have a vital role to play in continuing to supply nutritious
             food and income for rapidly growing populations on geographically isolated and
             economically disadvantaged small islands. These fisheries have unique characteristics
             that make them highly exposed and sensitive to the effects of climate change, but
             also possess flexibility and the capacity to adapt to future change. Investigating the
             strengths and weaknesses of small island fisheries requires a strategy that documents
             people or places that are most susceptible to harm (Downing et al., 2002; Polsky et al.,
             2007), identifies the capacity of island systems to adapt to changing climate conditions,
             and provides adaptation strategies that incorporate diverse environmental and social
             drivers within a common framework.
                For fisheries on small islands, ensuring the implementation of effective primary
             fisheries management is a fundamental action that will underpin all other adaptation
             efforts. Without it, effective adaptation will be compromised. However, there are
             multiple adaptation options suitable for small island fisheries, and it is likely that a suite
             of options will be needed to ensure that small island communities are best prepared for
             future climate impacts. This paper provides a brief synopsis of adaptation options to
             inform choices for local adaptation efforts.
Climate change adaptation: vulnerability and challenges facing small-scale fisheries on small islands   75




   The track record of small island states in implementing sustainable fisheries
management is variable but generally poor, largely because of a lack of resources and
capacity. Therefore, there is an imperative for assistance to small island states with
limited capacity to fill these gaps and facilitate local government and community
efforts to adapt to the challenge of climate change. Further, these efforts must also be
supported as much as possible with relevant and appropriate policy and/or regulation
to help ensure decisions translate into affirmative action. Similarly, incorporating
climate change into the policy of small island states has been slow and may require
further support and capacity. Therefore, support is not only needed in policy
development and identification of tools, but also in moving to implementation of
policy and development of simple but effective governance systems to support ongoing
management.
   As profound as the effects of climate change are expected to be on small island
fisheries, they will be overshadowed by the effects of population growth on the
availability of fish for food (per capita) and income for many years to come. The onus is
on governments, communities and their development partners to implement a suite of
adaptations as soon as possible to address both of these important drivers and minimize
negative outcomes. Incorporating local knowledge, capacity and governance will be
key components of successful adaptation to minimize climate change vulnerability and
enhance the resilience of small-scale fisheries in small islands states.

Impact of climate change and
variability on fishing and
aquaculture in Central American
Integration System participating
countries: strategic action

ABSTRACT
In 2009, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) noted
that there was a strong emphasis on the issue of climate change specifically related
to agriculture. However, there was no work focused on adaptation and mitigation of
climate change impacts on fishing and aquaculture, even though global fishing and
aquaculture production provided 110 million tonnes of fish for human consumption
in 2006, equivalent to a theoretical per capita supply of 16.7 kg (equivalent in live
weight) a figure that was among the highest up to that point (SOFIA/FAO 2008).
Furthermore, FAO noted that it was essential to consider that alterations in the aquatic
environment caused by global warming would impact in the first instance on hydro-
biological resources, particularly those of interest to fishing or aquaculture; therefore,
it was important to incorporate climate change issues into the fisheries and aquaculture
sector. The Organization for the Fishing and Aquaculture Sector of the Central
American Isthmus (OSPESCA) raised the issue to the level of the Ministers responsible
for fisheries and aquaculture as well as to the level of Presidents of the States of the
Central American Integration System (SICA), so that the issue of impact of climate
change and variability in fishing and aquaculture was officially incorporated into the
Fisheries and Aquaculture Integration Policy 2015—2025.
   Within the framework of the aforementioned policy and under the command of the
Central American Agricultural Council (CAC) and the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals, OSPESCA has designed a Regional Action Plan for Climate-
Smart Fisheries and Aquaculture with eight actions: creating and/or strengthening of
capacities; promoting the development of fisheries and aquaculture with the ecosystem
approach in the framework of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing and the
Code of Ethics; establishing a baseline on regional fishery and aquaculture production
and variability and climate change; creating mechanisms to improve conditions of water
resources and renewable energies usage; organizing territories to optimize the use of
resources; using the market; disseminating information; ensuring financial sources.

INTRODUCTION
Central America is a region particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate extremes,
with losses and damage amounting to millions of dollars after each extreme event.
One of the most recent events, tropical storm 12E (2011) resulted in losses of about
USD 2 billion (Table 1).

             Source: CEPAL 2011.


                 Other climate events have also been very destructive, for example: Mitch (1998)
             left the Central American region with USD 5 000 million in losses and Agatha (2010)
             caused USD 1 500 million in losses and 194 deaths. In the Global Climate Risk Index
             2017 (Kreft, Eckstein and Melchior, 2016) some countries of the Isthmus have been
             classified among the most vulnerable in the world.
                 In the specific case of fisheries and aquaculture the region is particularly vulnerable
             in areas such as shrimp aquaculture, inland fishing and marine fishing. Tropical Storm
             12E caused four countries in the region to suffer losses of USD 6 million. In the
             case of shrimp aquaculture, farms are mostly located on the Pacific coast of Central
             America that suffer from excess rainfall generated by tropical storms and depressions,
             hurricanes, among others, but shrimp aquaculture and tilapia also suffer from droughts
             generated by events such as El Niño.
                 Both continental and small-scale marine fisherfolk reduce their activities when
             storms, tropical depressions or hurricanes occur because of the risks of the winds,
             sea behavior and waves, associated with these phenomena. During droughts, the
             reduction of water inputs in inland waterbodies concentrates the load of pollutants
             they receive, with consequences for the health of both humans and animals, as well as
             for productivity.
                 The Organization for the Fishing and Aquaculture Sector of the Central American
             Isthmus (OSPESCA)11 as a regional intergovernmental organization addresses various
             topics in coordination with other SICA organs, among them climate change and
             variability in relation to fishing and aquaculture. This topic has been included in the
             Regional Strategy on Agro-environment and Health – ERAS – (CAC/COMISCA/
             CCAD/SICA 2009) and in the Regional Strategy on Climate Change (CCAD-SICA
             2010).
                 The participating countries in the OSPESCA/SICA are: Belize, the Republic of
             Costa Rica, the Republic of El Salvador, the Republic of Guatemala, the Republic of
             Honduras, the Republic of Nicaragua, the Republic of Panamá and the Dominican
             Republic.
                 OSPESCA, a member of the Global Partnership for Climate, Fisheries and
             Aquaculture (PaCFA), for its part, includes nine strategic areas in its regional policy:
                • institutional and organizational strengthening;
                • regional governance;
                • management of fisheries and aquaculture;
                • climate change in fisheries and aquaculture;
                • sustainable fisheries and aquaculture;
                • aquatic and fishing safety;
                • intra regional trade and extra regional trade;

Impact of climate change and variability on fishing and aquaculture in Central American Integration System   83




   • fisheries and aquaculture with tourism; and
   • international relations.
   The climate change in fishing and aquaculture component includes actions such as:
   • strengthening interaction with regional and international entities that directly
      address variability and climate change;
   • adopting measures to prepare SICA countries to deal with and mitigate the
      impacts that natural phenomena such as red tides, acidification of the oceans,
      hurricanes, tsunamis can have in the short-term, medium-term and long-term on
      fishery resources and aquaculture;
   • making efforts to continue and strengthen information-gathering initiatives with
      the participation of regional associations of fishermen and fish farmers;
   • establishing a working group of experts from the SICA countries to advise the
      national and regional fishing and aquaculture institutions by proposing regional
      measures to manage the effects of climate variability; and
   • strengthening regional dissemination mechanisms so that the citizens, particularly
      those engaged in fishing and aquaculture can be adequately informed about
      climate variability and the measures being taken to mitigate its impacts.
   This paper describes the steps taken to include climate change and variability in
relation to fishing and aquaculture in the Fisheries and Aquaculture Integration Policy
2015—2025.

METHODS
To consider the impacts of climate change and variability in fishing and aquaculture
on the sustainable use of hydro-biological and aquaculture resources, and to include
them in a regional governance model with binding agreements, as well as to develop
cooperation, investigation, training, promotion, among others, it has been necessary to
perform the following steps:
   1. take into account the proposals of fishers and aquaculture workers about the
      impact of climate change and variability in fishing and aquaculture activities;
   2. include the topic in regional discussions about the Integration Policy for Fisheries
      and Aquaculture (2015—2025);
   3. gain the approval of the Policy by the Council of Ministers responsible for
      fisheries and aquaculture activities in the Central American Integration System;
      and
   4. support the Policy through an Agreement at the Forty-fifth Summit of Heads of
      State or Heads of Government of country members of SICA.

RESULTS
In The Regular Meeting of Ministers of the Central American Agricultural Council
(CAC), held on 20 August 2015 in the Republic of San Salvador it was agreed to
take medium-term and long-term actions to adapt to climate change and through a
Regional Action Plan for Climate-smart Agriculture (including agriculture, fisheries,
aquaculture, livestock, forestry). OSPESCA is making efforts to follow such a mandate.
   Moreover, OSPESCA has worked to integrate the issues of climatic variability and
climate change into the activities of fishermen and fish farmers through the following
actions:
   • establishing a regional working group on climate variability and climate change
      implications for fisheries and aquaculture;
   • initiating dialogue and exchange of information with fisheries and aquaculture
      stakeholders in the countries of SICA about these topics;
   • strengthening the information gathering initiatives with the participation of
      regional fishing and aquaculture associations; and
   • strengthening mass media communications on the subject.

                So far, the route to incorporate the issue of climate change and variability into the
             agenda of decision-makers and the knowledge and understanding of fishermen and
             fish farmers from the countries of the Central American Integration System (SICA)
             has been presented.
                These major objectives have been achieved; however, there is a need to increase
             knowledge on climate phenomena and their relationship to fisheries and aquaculture,
             as well as gain concrete support from authorities, producers, civil society and
             international cooperation to achieve levels of adaptation and resilience that allow
             maintaining and increasing productive levels for a growing population through the
             responsible and sustainable use of natural resources.

             SICA-OSPESCA strategy to address climate change in fisheries and aquaculture
             OSPESCA, within the framework of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Integration Policy
             2015—2025, under the mandate of the Central American Agricultural Council (CAC)
             and the Sustainable Development Objectives, has designed the Regional Action Plan
             for Climate-Smart Fisheries and Aquaculture summarized below:
Impact of climate change and variability on fishing and aquaculture in Central American Integration System   85




Action Plan for Climate-Smart Fisheries and Aquaculture:

Relevant facts
Currently, in 2016, Central America is home to 44.6 million inhabitants, by 2050 it will
be about 106 million (more than double), with an average per capita income that will
triple by 2050. This translates into greater capacity to purchase among the inhabitants.
Food production by 2050 should rise by 50 percent. This increase in production should
take place on the same land that is currently used for agriculture.

Challenge
It is necessary to plan, to innovate and to generate new technologies, among others,
that lead the region to produce and increase food production, limiting damage to
natural resources and increasing resilience despite climate change and variability.

Definition of the plan
Climate-smart fishing and aquaculture is an approach to develop technical, political
and investment conditions to achieve sustainable aquaculture and fishing development,
food security and welfare generation, even under conditions of climate change and
variability.

Components of the plan:
  ü creating and/or strengthening of capacities;
  ü promoting the development of fisheries and aquaculture with the ecosystem
    approach in the framework of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing and
    the Code of Ethics;
  ü establishing a baseline on regional fishery and aquaculture production and
    climate change and variability;
  ü establishing mechanisms to improve conditions of water resources and renewable
    energies usage;
  ü organizing territories to optimize the use of resources;
  ü using the market;
  ü disseminating information; and
  ü ensuring sources of finance.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The Regional Action Plan for Climate-smart Fisheries and Aquaculture is composed
of eight actions. The activities to be carried out by each action are described below.

Action 1: Creating and/ or strengthening of capacities
In the region, the issues of climate variability and change are recent and there is a
shortage of technical personnel who can deal with them.
   In order to foster a climate-smart fishing and aquaculture plan, the integration of
local and regional multidisciplinary working groups that receive information on climate
elements is needed; especially on those elements with the greatest impact on fisheries
and aquaculture activities, sources of information and, what is of major importance,
how to interpret them and relate them to fishing and aquaculture. Members of working
groups and other stakeholders are expected to be able to acquire skills to model
scenarios of climate variability and change related to fisheries and aquaculture.
   It is also important to include those fishermen and aquaculture farmers aware of the
threats of climate variability and change so that they can contribute their experience
and participate in the proposals related to adaptation and resilience measures.
   It is suggested that fishermen involved should be organized so that the agreements
reached, that relate to the anticipation of the climate change events, as well as the
86   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             adaptation and resilience actions that are achieved, might be shared with their
             membership and disseminated to all members of the sector.

             Action 2: Promoting the development of fisheries and aquaculture with the
             ecosystem approach in the framework of the Code of Conduct for Responsible
             Fishing, the Code of Ethics and the integration of biodiversity in fisheries
             In Central America, OSPESCA and FAO have developed some efforts to apply the
             ecosystem approach, the most recent project being: Strengthening Interdisciplinary
             Research for Responsible Fishing in Central American Countries (FIINPESCA)
             — where aspects such as biological indicators of the shrimp and lobster fishery,
             macroeconomic indicators, value chains, employment, incorporation of women,
             climate factors and fisheries management aspects (governance) are analysed (FAO/
             OSPESCA/SUECIA, 2009).
                In aquaculture, water use is crucial, quantitatively, qualitatively and also its
             distribution. Also, climate-related changes exacerbate pests. These and other factors
             that may become limiting and risky for aquaculture should be considered.

             There are three crucial elements for climate-smart aquaculture:
                a) improve productivity in a sustainable way;
                b) increase adaptability and resilience to shocks; and
                c) reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                In the SICA countries, fishermen and aqua-farmers have approved the Code of
             Ethics for Responsible Fishing and Aquaculture in the States of the Central American
             Isthmus (OSPESCA, 2011). The Code´s application is not binding in all Central
             American countries however.
                The objective of the Code of Ethics is to serve as a framework for the process of
             harmonization of regulations and update of national legislation within the Central
             American Integration System in fishing and aquaculture issues. This code is valuable
             for the governance of the sector and the measures that can be taken in relation to
             climate change.

             Action 3: Establishing a baseline on regional fishery and aquaculture
             production and variability and climate change
             To find relationships among fishing, aquaculture and climate requires information. On
             climate, there are multiple sources. The meteorological services of each country in the
             region have historical records of more than 30 years. International climate services offer
             different types of information in daily, weekly, monthly and annual series. However,
             the weakness is found in fishing and aquaculture data, mainly in fisheries.
                 Relationships among fishing, aquaculture and climate cannot be found when one
             of the components of the equation does not have recent data. This is a weakness that
             must be overcome.
                 The countries of the region make great efforts to have records of the production of
             fishing and aquaculture; however, for different reasons that information is always out
             of date. In contrast, the information on climatological aspects is up to date. The ability
             to forecast based on historical information allows the generation of alerts.
                 The OSPESCA Information Collection Project in collaboration with Confederation
             of Artisanal Fishermen of Central America (CONFEPESCA) has fishermen who collect
             daily data in previously selected fishing ports: If both information (climatological and
             production) are available, we can establish relations (at the moment empirical) which
             explain some behaviors of the resources of interest for fishing. This practice, little by
             little, creates a sufficient base that allows acting in advance before the climate change
             phenomena occur, obtaining good levels of adaptation and increasing the resilience
             capacity.

Action 4: Establishing mechanisms to improve conditions of water resources
and renewable energies usage
The contribution of fishing and aquaculture to the increase of greenhouse gas
concentrations is minimal; however, this does not exempt them from the responsibility
of implementing measures to reduce the emission of these gases.
   The measures might include, for example: the use of more efficient engines, with
a maintenance programme to ensure their optimal operation; the use of innovative
technologies for water recirculation; the use of fishing gear and equipment that do not
offer drag resistance, to reduce fuel consumption; the use of alternative sources of clean
energy; the reduction of discards and waste.

Action 5: Organizing territories to optimize the use of resources
There are areas that because of their characteristics have conditions for certain uses;
the management of territories, in order to make more efficient the use of the resources
found in the area, is an option.
   With this type of territorial management the bureaucratic processes of authorization,
monitoring, organization of the producers, establishment of sanitary measures,
willingness to use alternative energy, among others, are facilitated. It is also more
efficient to implement adaptation and resilience measures, as well as to implement early
warnings.

Action 6: Using the market
The market can make an important contribution to the sustainable management of
resources under critical conditions, such as increasing the consumption of products
captured or produced through the use of renewable energy.
   Markets can reward those producers who are concerned about reducing greenhouse
gas emissions, as well as those who produce through optimizing water use systems that
do not contaminate the environment.
   The creation of an authority or a seal that guarantees compliance with sustainability
and quality aspects could be a stimulus for markets to better appreciate the region’s
fishery and aquaculture products.
   The publication and promotion of successful cases can add value to regional efforts;
the buyers could reward their suppliers, with their preference and promotion, as
successful cases that generate a plus for their sales.

Action 7: Disseminating information
In general, marine and freshwater aquaculture biodiversity is affected first by the
changes caused by climate variability, particularly resources of interest to fishing
and aquaculture; the producers associated with the use of resources also realize the
changes. These impacts may be negative such as the deepening or migration of dorado
or common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) in the Eastern Pacific, or positive such
as the acceleration of mollusk reproduction in the Republic of Peru, both an effect of
El Niño.
   Such events, some of which are very visible and some others not so much, sometimes
go unnoticed in the fisheries and aquaculture sector or are attributed to other factors.
   Climate-smart fishing and aquaculture should consider the processes of disseminating
information about the climate and the relationship with the sector. The information
must be timely and must be presented in an understandable way, especially the relevant
aspects of the climate, fishing and aquaculture relationship prior, during and after the
development of the phenomena.
   OSPESCA is progressing regionally on this issue. The creation of specialized media
such as the CLIMAPESCA weekly newsletter, which is regularly distributed on Monday
of each week, aims to fill the information void; however, it is necessary to improve it and
88   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             to make it more popular. Currently, OSPESCA is moving towards the establishment
             of an electronic medium and the development of mobile applications that will allow
             interacting with the sector in real time. This work is done in partnership with other SICA
             entities, and with the support of the United States Agency for International Development
             (USAID), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the
             Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center (CATIE).
                However, this is not enough; OSPESCA considers it necessary to reach farmers and
             fishermen through meetings, exchanges of opinion, evaluation of verifiable cases, and
             to listen to their concerns and proposals. Intensifying communication is an effective
             way to accelerate adaptive and resilient processes.
                OSPESCA, with the support of Centro Clima, the climate information system
             for the countries of the Central American Integration, has prepared for this year
             (2017) a training programme for technicians and producers in the management of new
             communication tools based on CLIMAPESCA, as well as a sustainability programme
             for the tools described above.

             Action 8: Ensuring sources of finance
             The Action Plan for Climate-Smart Fishing must have long-term financing activities,
             for its execution and continuity, which may consist of incorporating the regional
             requirements for adaptation of fisheries and aquaculture into the Green Fund of the
             United Nations or acting as a reference for research on the subject in the region.

ABSTRACT
Unexpected temperature variations and rainfall patterns have direct, adverse impacts
on shrimp farmers in northwestern Sri Lanka. Specifically, changing climatic conditions
impact patterns of shrimp disease spread along an interconnected lagoon and make it
difficult for shrimp farmers to predict and control the lagoon—the primary water
source for coastal shrimp aquaculture. This paper examines how small-scale shrimp
farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change by collectively managing shrimp disease.
We studied three shrimp farming communities in northwestern Sri Lanka and analysed
adaptation using a social-ecological resilience approach with a four-part framework:
(1) living with uncertainty — shrimp farmers deal with the uncertain nature of the
shrimp business by controlling (rather than trying to eliminate) disease; (2) nurturing
diversity — farmers tend to diversify their income sources to include other activities
and they also increase the risk of disease by dispersing pond waste water in space and
time; (3) employing different kinds of knowledge — farmers combine their experience
with large-scale (failed) companies, their own experience, government technical
expertise, and new knowledge from adaptive management (the “zonal crop calendar
system”); and (4) creating opportunities for self-organization — farmers have built on
their experiences with producer cooperatives, known as samithi, to self-organize into
a multi-level community-based management structure. Collaboration and collective
action are central features of this adaptation mechanism. This small-scale shrimp
aquaculture system is persistent, i.e. sustainable and resilient because it is continually
adapting.

INTRODUCTION
The aim of this paper is to examine how small-scale shrimp farmers adapt to the
impacts of climate change by collectively managing shrimp diseases. The paper argues
that building resilience can be one viable option for climate change adaptation and
specifically answers two questions: (1) How do small-scale shrimp farmers adapt to
the impacts of climate change by collectively managing shrimp diseases? (2) What are
the sources of resilience?
   We studied three small-scale shrimp farming communities in the northwestern
region of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. All coastal aquaculture in the
northwestern region produces black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon). The Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is a small-scale shrimp producer in terms of quantity,
but this case study provides unique insights into adaptation and resource management.

             Large-scale shrimp farming survived in the country only from the late 1970s to the
             mid-1990s. However, small-scale shrimp farming has persisted since the early 1990s.
             It is important to know therefore if shrimp aquaculture in the hands of small-scale
             producers can be made more resilient and thus more adaptable to climate change.
                Most literature about shrimp aquaculture concentrates on the wide range of adverse
             social and environmental implications (Belton, 2016; Benessaiah and Sengupta, 2014).
             The impacts of large-scale shrimp aquaculture are unpredictable and inequitable
             (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2014), depending on the level of vulnerability of social-
             ecological systems (Bush et al., 2010). Few scientific studies illustrate how to engage in
             sustainable shrimp aquaculture (De Silva and Davy, 2010).
                Recent literature on the country’s shrimp aquaculture reflects diverse perspectives.
             For instance, Harkes et al. (2015) identified shrimp aquaculture as a vehicle for climate-
             compatible development, suggesting how the sector can support the mitigation of
             greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to climate change impacts while stimulating
             rural development, aligning with the previous government’s (Mahinda Chinthana)
             development plan. Bournazel et al., (2015) described the impacts of shrimp farming,
             focusing on land use and carbon storage around Puttlam Lagoon. Galappaththi and
             Berkes (2013) examined the northwestern shrimp aquaculture using a social-ecological
             systems approach, focusing on the surviving small-scale shrimp farmers and how they
             deal creatively with uncertainties and complexities in natural resources management.
             Small-scale shrimp aquaculture operations have maintained close relationships with the
             environment on which, along with natural resources, they depend for their livelihoods
             and well-being. Interestingly, government statistics show incremental improvement
             in aquaculture shrimp production since 2005. Almost all national shrimp aquaculture
             production comes from tiger shrimp farming in the northwestern region (Figure 1).

                This paper analyses adaptation to climate change among small-scale shrimp
             farmers in northwestern region of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
             A social-ecological resilience approach with a four-part framework is used. The
             approach emphasizes neither the ecosystem alone nor the social system alone but
             rather the interconnected social-ecological system as the unit of study (Berkes et al.,
             2003). Resilience is “the ability of a system to absorb or rebound from disturbance
             without shifting to another fundamentally different system configuration” (Armitage
             et al., 2007: 330). Social-ecological resilience is a key aspect related to the building of

adaptive capacity (Berkes et al., 2003). The framework we use identifies four ways
to build social-ecological resilience to adapt to environment and climate change:
(1) living with change and uncertainty; (2) nurturing diversity; (3) fostering learning;
and (4) combining different kinds of knowledge (Folke et al., 2003). Adaptation is the
act of making something fit a new situation or use (Adger et al., 2009). The literature
highlights the importance of the cultural dimensions of climate adaptation (Adger
et al., 2013), and private sector engagement (Tompkins and Eakin, 2012).

METHODS
The study was undertaken using a qualitative case study approach (Hancock and
Algozzine, 2015). Mixed data collection methods were used to capture the wide range
of representative data on different local climate-adaptation and resilience-building
efforts (Berg, 2016). First, participant observation was conducted in three shrimp
farming communities in the northwestern region to obtain a contextual understanding
of shrimp farming operations and climate adaptation. The data collection was carried
out from 2012 to 2013; it involved spending time in shrimp farming communities and
actively engaging in daily shrimp farming operations such as post-larvae stocking,
water quality monitoring, shrimp harvesting, and attending producer cooperative
meetings.
   Second, semi-structured interview data were collected from 38 shrimp farmers
using snowball sampling to obtain diverse and detailed qualitative data about collective
action (Ostrom, 1990) undertaken with respect to climate adaptation, such as a zonal
crop calendar system, the use of different kinds of knowledge for building climate
resilience, and the role of producer cooperatives. Third, three focus group discussions
were organized with shrimp farmers and government officers in each community to
understand the overall shrimp aquaculture governance structure and to learn how
information flows from the local to the national level for decision-making. Focus
group meetings were used to clarify and validate other data collected though participant
observation and interviews.
   Fourth, seven key informant interviews were conducted with relevant government
officers, feed suppliers, hatchery owners, members of shrimp processing companies,
and other reputable and experienced people in the sector, including the shrimp
farmers who introduced the present zonal crop calendar system. Finally, 28 unplanned
on-the-spot interviews were conducted during national-level and zonal-level meetings.
Analysis of the data began after the labeling and coding of each piece of subscribed
data. Content analysis was supplemented with mind maps and management processes
were used to create themes and bring meaning to the findings. This research was
conducted in accordance with the Canadian ethical guidelines for research and the
research protocols of the University of Manitoba, Canada.
   The study area is in the coastal belt of the northwestern province of the country.
Shrimp farming is the dominant industry in this area because of the specific soil
characteristics and the brackish water required for black tiger shrimp aquaculture
(Galappaththi and Berkes, 2015a). The brackish water is found in three lagoons—
Chilaw, Mundel, and Puttlam. Coconut plantations and mangrove areas are among
the most common types of vegetation found in the northwestern coastal belt.
Income-generating activities related to shrimp aquaculture include shrimp broodstock
collecting, hatcheries, shrimp farming, middlemen shrimp harvest collectors, shrimp
processing and export companies, feed suppliers, and laboratory services (Galappaththi
et al., 2016).
   In terms of the profile of shrimp farmers, most of them (42 percent) were between
the ages of 40 and 50 years old. The youngest group consisted of three farmers
(8 percent) under 30 years old. Shrimp aquaculture experience within a community
ranged from 2 to 15 years, with a majority (66 percent) having more than 10 years
92   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             of experience. The majority (37 percent) had some level of high school education,
             whereas 26 percent graduated from high school. Most (72 percent) shrimp farming
             operations were family-based, involving family labour and the wife, son, daughter,
             and other relatives, who contributed labour, kept the books, managed the farm, and
             engaged in producer cooperative activities. Almost all recorded shrimp farms were
             owner-operated. In terms of the scale of the operations, the size range of the pond
             area (pond size) varied from 0.2 hectares to 0.8 hectares. In 2012-2013, the majority
             (37 percent) of farmers operated two to five ponds. Some experienced shrimp farmers
             recalled that the large-scale shrimp operations in the 1990s were about 150 hectares in
             size (Galappaththi, 2013).
                Climate change impacts northwestern shrimp aquaculture in the form of droughts,
             unusual monsoon patterns and floods, and unexpected temperature fluctuations (De
             Silva et al., 2007). Climate impacts vary depending on the shrimp farming area. The
             southern part of the northwestern coastal region (Chilaw Lagoon) is characterized by
             relatively wet (raining and flooding) climatic conditions, with lagoon water salinity
             varying mostly by single digits. Unusual salinity drops in the Chilaw Lagoon system
             can increase the incidence of shrimp diseases. The northern part of the coastal belt is
             dominated by dry (drought) conditions, and water salinity in Puttlam Lagoon remains
             high (up to about 70 percent), creating unfavourable conditions for shrimp growth.
             Adequate rainfall between crop seasons helps flush out sediments from tanks that
             contain mud and debris, which could lead to poor water quality. Inadequate rain leaves
             shrimp farmers more susceptible to shrimp disease. Furthermore, unexpected extreme
             weather events such as flooding (e.g. the May 2016 floods) can damage elements of
             shrimp farming infrastructure, such as ponds and canals.

             RESULTS
             Shrimp aquaculture operations started in the late 1970s with four multi-national
             companies (Liver Brothers’, Enris, Carson, and Andrew’s) that initiated large-scale
             operations in an integrated fashion (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2014). Local people who
             worked in large companies learned shrimp farming techniques and later started small-
             sized and medium-sized shrimp farming upon the failure of the large companies in
             the face of challenges mainly related to shrimp disease (mainly white spot syndrome).
Climate change adaptation in coastal shrimp aquaculture: a case from northwestern Sri Lanka        93




Shrimp disease is the primary adverse effect of the impacts of climate change on
shrimp aquaculture in the northwestern region. The industry suffered a series of
shrimp disease outbreaks (in 1989, 1996, and 1998) with significant damage to the
sector. Presently, almost all northwestern shrimp farmers are small-scale farmers. These
shrimp farmers together identified the key issue of the industry—shrimp disease spread
by the interconnected lagoons (Figure 2). This body of water consists of mainly three
lagoons and connects to the canal (called the Dutch Canal) running from the Colombo
Kalani river mouth to the Puttalam Lagoon. Almost all the shrimp farmers rely on
this interconnected lagoon for withdrawing and discharging used pond water. Shrimp
farmers identified patterns of the spread of shrimp disease through the Dutch Canal,
which varies with annual weather events and patterns. Once shrimp farms discharge
disease-infected water into the common body of water, it starts spreading all over the
water flow. The dynamics of the spread of disease depend on weather patterns such as
monsoon rain.
   The key solution, thus, is to manage discharge and withdrawal dates from the common
body of water. This serves to control (but not eradicate) shrimp disease. However, the
solution requires collective action, action undertaken together by all shrimp producers
connected to the lagoon to achieve a common (rather than individual) objective. Shrimp
farmers achieved collective action through their community association (producer
cooperative), collaborating with other producer cooperatives. This system is known as
the “zonal crop calendar system” (ZCCS). ZCCS was introduced by shrimp farmers
with the support of the National Aquaculture Development Authority of Sri Lanka
(NAQDA) and private-sector shrimp farming stakeholders such as feed suppliers,
hatcheries, processing companies, and consultancy servicers (all together called the Sri
Lanka Aquaculture Development Association (SLADA) —the sector association for
the shrimp industry).
   How does ZCCS work? Shrimp farmers divide the northwestern shrimp farming
area into five zones, with each zone divided into several sub-zones (equivalent to
shrimp farming communities). Initially, these zones were created after a study of the
spreading patterns of shrimp disease over the past years. Shrimp farmers, SLADA, and
NAQDA collaboratively decided which zone (or sub-zone) can (or cannot) support
farming during a particular crop season (three crops per year). This crop calendar is
finalized after a series of meetings, which tend to involve many debates and arguments;
individual and community-level power dynamics play a visible role in these debates.
ZCCS became an annual process because of the ongoing but unpredictable impacts
of climate change, such as unusual monsoon patterns and floods, and unexpected
temperature fluctuations. As shrimp farmers are not farming in all three crop seasons,
most farmers (85 percent) can diversify into other income-generating activities, such as
fishing, vegetable farming, shrimp feed selling, and coconut farming. ZCCS is judged
to be working well, both by farmers and government officials According to one
NAQDA officer:
      Before introduction of ZCCS, white spot [disease] spread aggressively in large areas
      and result[ed in] huge losses to many shrimp farms. But, now, with the implementation
      of ZCCS farmers are not getting such losses. We know [we still] have white spot
      disease in our lagoons and we are still getting diseases [in] certain parts of the lagoon,
      but we have minimize[d] the risk of losing [the] shrimp harvest because of [the] low
      occurrence of shrimp disease.

   ZCCS is managed by the multi-level institutional structure (Galappaththi and
Berkes, 2014) that has evolved over time. Shrimp farmers have had community-level
associations since the 1990s. Some of them were registered under the Sri Lankan
cooperatives act and some were registered under relevant divisional secretariat officers.
With the problems related to shrimp disease, farmers organized and formed the
94   Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             national-sector association SLADA. Development of ZCCS led to the creation of five
             zonal shrimp farmers’ associations to represent multiple community associations. To
             strengthen the implementation of ZCCS, SLADA asked that the Ministry of Fisheries
             engage a government institute as a facilitator and monitor of the system. Since 2004-
             2005, SLADA and NAQDA have collaboratively worked for ZCCS implementation.
             Annual zonal crop calendar meetings start at the community level, eliciting shrimp
             farmers’ feedback about previous crops and thoughts about coming crops. This
             feedback is forwarded to the SLADA-NAQDA decision-making body through
             zonal institutions (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2015b). All levels (from shrimp farmer
             community to the national level) are represented in the final meeting and decisions are
             made collaboratively.

                Multi-level adapting institutions drive the ZCCS. Presently, maintaining membership
             in the producer cooperatives is obligatory for carrying out shrimp farming in the
             northwestern area. This creates a mechanism for networking and access to the right
             information, such as good shrimp feed brands, shrimp market prices, selling experience
             with processing companies, and disease active areas. The producer cooperative helps
             community farmers work collectively and share their knowledge related to shrimp
             aquaculture. For example, during a shrimp harvesting event, cooperative members get
             together to help their fellow members. Some cooperatives provide compensation to
             farmers who have diseased ponds (depending on the average size of the shrimp at the
             harvest). The cooperative is the place where farmers share their farming techniques
             during monthly meetings. Moreover, cooperatives send their member farmers to
             government-sponsored technical workshops and to other relevant knowledge-
             gathering meetings in the region.
                Some shrimp farmers have an understanding of the importance of lunar cycles
             and mangrove vegetation for the shrimp farming environment, and they use that
             knowledge to foster better shrimp farming techniques. For example, some farmers
             do not harvest on full-moon nights. Water pumping of the ponds is done only at a
             certain time of day, taking into account the tides and currents. Certain farmers in the
             region seem to be less vulnerable to shrimp disease. These shrimp farms are covered
             by dense mangrove vegetation. Field observations found that the inlet water of these
             farms is filtered through millions of mangrove roots. These farmers rely on the same
Climate change adaptation in coastal shrimp aquaculture: a case from northwestern Sri Lanka                  95




raw material sources (post-larvae, feed), as do other farmers who continue to be highly
vulnerable to shrimp diseases.

DISCUSSION
Sri Lankan coastal shrimp aquaculture shows the results of efforts to build resilience
and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Collaboratively managing the ZCCS for
disease control is the key to building resilience. The ZCCS seems to work because:
1) ZCCS is developed and introduced by the shrimp farmers themselves with the
support of government institutions (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2015b); 2) the multi-
level and bottom-up institutional structure of ZCCS facilitates the crop calendar
development process (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2014); 3) shrimp farmers, the
government, and the private sector are cooperatively involved in decision-making in
ZCCS (Tompkins and Eakin, 2012), 4) ZCCS is an adaptive process evolving annually
(Galappaththi and Berkes, 2015b); and 5) collective action and collaboration are the
heart of the ZCCS mechanism (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2015a). We discuss the
adaptation of Sri Lankan shrimp farmers using a social-ecological resilience approach
with a four-part framework.
   First, shrimp farmers learn to live with change and uncertainty by managing
shrimp diseases (and their outcomes) rather than trying to eliminate the diseases
(Berkes et al., 2003). Large-scale companies left the aquaculture industry upon the
outbreaks of shrimp disease because they could not survive in the midst of the changes
and uncertainties created by the disease. However, small-scale shrimp farmers in
the northwestern region collectively faced the challenges of the disease by adopting
an annual zonal crop calendar based on the memory of past events, such as shrimp
diseases and weather pattern changes (Folke et al., 2003).
   Second, shrimp farmers use diversification strategies for climate adaptation. They
manage disease risk by controlling the release of used pond water in space and time
(Galappaththi and Berkes, 2015b). Before the introduction of ZCCS, the lagoon water
system was used by shrimp farmers throughout the year to withdraw and discharge
pond water (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2014). At such times, shrimp disease can spread
over the lagoon faster than at present and create large losses for most of the farmers
connected to the lagoon via water (disease conditions can remain present for a long
period of time). Because ZCCS limits boundaries in space and time, the spread of
disease is restricted to smaller geographical areas, and losses for farmers are relatively
smaller and more recoverable. By taking turns at using lagoon water, shrimp farmers
spread the risk of disease. In addition, limited crops per year allow shrimp farmers to
engage with other sources of income and not be limited to shrimp aquaculture.
   Third, shrimp farmers use different kinds of knowledge (Table 1). Farmers
combine their experiences with large-scale (failed) companies, their own experiences
TABLE 1
Types of knowledge adopted by shrimp farmers
 Type of knowledge            Description
 Shrimp production            Current small-scale shrimp farmers learned shrimp farming techniques from
 techniques                   pioneering multinational companies during the late 1970s and 1980s. This
                              knowledge continues to evolve from generation to generation.
 Marketing knowledge          Community associations provide required updated information related to
                              shrimp marketing, selling prices and buyers, feed brands and prices.
 Local environmental          This includes how to use mangroves to minimize shrimp disease risk, when
 knowledge                    water should be pumped into the ponds, and harvesting with consideration
                              of the lunar cycle (to minimize the risk of shrimp disease).
 Knowledge and practice       Sri Lanka has a tradition of collective action. Shrimp farmers apply this
 with respect to collective   knowledge to face their challenges, creating cooperatives, associations, and
 action                       other groups to work efficiently.
 Co-produced knowledge        By working together and sharing and learning from each other, and working
                              together with SLADA and NAQDA, shrimp farmers combine and co-produce
                              new knowledge.

             as farmers, and government-sponsored technical workshops on shrimp production.
             Shrimp farmers’ local knowledge about mangroves and lunar cycles indicates their
             close relationship to nature and natural resources (Galappaththi, 2013); they apply this
             knowledge to their day to day shrimp aquaculture operations, but the actual effectiveness
             of this knowledge has not been studied or explained. Furthermore, Sri Lankan shrimp
             farmers maintain local and traditional knowledge about collective action. The country
             has a history of collective action, especially in the fisher cooperatives in the coastal
             fisheries sector. Shrimp farmers’ associations include informed members who have
             up to date marketing information. Community institutions play a significant role in
             helping shrimp farmers share and co-produce knowledge.
                 Fourth, Sri Lankan shrimp aquaculture cases show how to foster learning
             while living with the challenge of disease. Farmers have built on their experiences
             with producers’ cooperatives to self-organize into a multi-level community-based
             management structure. This structure allows shrimp farmers to learn at multiple
             levels of governance (community, zonal, and national levels). The ZCCS is revised
             yearly. Every year, shrimp farmers learn from their ZCCS and bring those lessons to
             formulate the next year’s crop calendar. Producers’ cooperatives play a large role in
             bringing these lessons to the national level. The system uses feedback and operates on
             the basis of “learning by doing” (Folke et al., 2003).
                 These four sources of resilience from small-scale farmers can be recognized as
             different but interrelated ways to adapt to the impacts of climate change in shrimp
             aquaculture. However, we are not arguing that the shrimp aquaculture governance
             in the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is perfect in terms of equitable
             distribution of benefits among farmers, as power imbalances inherent throughout the
             process can affect the resilience of social-ecological systems. However, the overall
             effectiveness of the ZCCS and the methods of resilience building in this aquaculture
             system are reflected in the sustainability and gradual increase in aquaculture shrimp
             production as shown in Figure 1 earlier.
                 How does climate change impact shrimp aquaculture governance in the northwestern
             region? ZCCS is the prime mechanism to build resilience for facing the challenge of
             shrimp disease. Crop calendar planning is based on the prevailing shrimp disease in
             the lagoon, whereas weather predictions rely on past weather experiences. From a
             social-ecological resilience perspective, unexpected and extreme weather increases the
             uncertainty and complexities of northwestern shrimp aquaculture social-ecological
             systems. Furthermore, shrimp farmers modify and adapt best management practices
             introduced by the NAQDA at the community level as appropriate for the local
             environment. Unexpected changes in climate limit the effectiveness of these “better
             management practices.” However, shrimp farmers trying to manage the complexities
             and uncertainties created by climate change use an adaptive management (learning by
             doing) approach to implement ZCCS (Armitage et al., 2007). Implementation of ZCCS
             is supported by the sources of resilience identified above using a four-part framework
             (Folke et al., 2003).

             CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             In conclusion, shrimp disease spreading along the lagoon is the key challenge
             for Sri Lankan coastal shrimp farmers. Shrimp farmers have self-organized with
             government support, implementing a calendar system to manage shrimp disease
             impacts. Climate change impacts, such as unexpected weather and extreme events,
             increase the complexities and uncertainties of shrimp disease control. Resilient
             small-scale shrimp aquaculture hinges on the collective action of individual owners
             through producers’ cooperatives and collaborative multi-level management. Sources of
             resilience recognized in the Sri Lankan shrimp farming case include living with change
             and uncertainty, nurturing diversity, using different kinds of knowledge, and fostering
Climate change adaptation in coastal shrimp aquaculture: a case from northwestern Sri Lanka      97




learning, consistent with Folke et al., (2003). Small-scale shrimp aquaculture persists (it
is sustainable) because it is resilient and adaptive.
    This paper shows that sources of resilience, collaboration among stakeholders,
and collective action are the key features of adaptation. This study advances the
knowledge necessary to address issues that have theoretical significance for resource
management, and practical significance for sustainable aquaculture. The original
research project produced publications regarding institutions for managing aquaculture
commons (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2014), applications of commons theory to shrimp
aquaculture (Galappaththi and Berkes, 2015a), co-management (Galappaththi and
Berkes, 2015b), and information sharing through community cooperatives and its
impact on shrimp supply chain management (Galappaththi et al., 2016). The present
study provides insights for sources of adaptive capacity to deal with climate change.
Given current discussions about adaptation, climate change adaptation in Sri Lankan
coastal shrimp aquaculture deserves further attention.
    A better understanding of possible ways to adapt to climate change in shrimp
aquaculture requires theoretical and practical attention to expand the knowledge
base. Concepts of climate change adaptation and resilience require more attention to
apply to small-scale aquaculture settings in better ways. Only a limited number of
studies are available on resilience and climate adaptation in shrimp aquaculture. To
understand climate change adaptations and sources of resilience, regional-level (South
Asia, Southeast Asia) projects are needed to provide case studies for comparative
analysis. Finally, a substantial part of the world’s aquaculture production is coming
from small-scale producers. Thus, it is important to discover how community-based
institutions can carry out shrimp aquaculture as an alternative to large-scale commercial
aquaculture. This is not to suggest that large-scale shrimp production operations could
be completely replaced by community-based aquaculture. Rather, it is a potential
approach to build climate-adaptable, resilient aquaculture systems in the future.

ABSTRACT
The need for adaptation of aquaculture practices is expected to increase as climate
change impacts on the sector. Numerous options for aquaculture are reviewed and
research areas identified that would improve adaptive capacity of the sector to climate
change impacts. Suggestions for assessing and implementing potential adaptation
measures are built around two pillars: (1) the sustainable livelihoods framework; and
(2) an ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA). Risk assessment and management
along the value chain, and feasibility assessments should support these pillars. The
capacity of stakeholders to apply sustainable livelihoods analysis, risk assessments and
management, feasibility assessments, and an ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture
management should be strengthened.

INTRODUCTION
Farmed marine species have become the main source of fish for food in many nations.
By 2021, aquaculture is expected to surpass capture fisheries in terms of tonnes
produced. This share could reach 57 percent in 2025 (OECD-FAO, 2016). Aquaculture
will need to continue to provide food, materials and services to a growing population in
the face of uncertainties and risks posed by a changing climate. To do so it must adapt
to the changes. Adaptation is a process that aims to develop resilience and capacity
in vulnerable communities to enable them to prepare for and respond to potential
shocks and trends with minimum costs and to take advantage of new opportunities
responsibly and ethically (Daw et al., 2009).
   Adaptation to climate change can be a complex undertaking and poses many
challenges, especially as the demands by various sectors on common resources often
result in user conflicts. There is a greater level of human control over aquaculture
(De Silva and Soto, 2009), which enables the sector to better manage risks. But the
same degree of control makes it critical to have a properly planned and coordinated,
well-governed and equitable adaptation strategy. This stresses the need for precise
identification and characterization of the nature of hazards from climate change,
predicting and assessing the risks that the hazards drive, and their impacts. The types
of hazards spawned by climate change are physical, chemical and biological. Separately
or in combination they pose biological, environmental, economic and social risks. The
impacts or consequences, some positive, are contextual and depend on the vulnerability

             of the system. Although the final expression of risk impacts is social cost (or some gain),
             two critical gaps in understanding the dynamics of the risks remain: (i) understanding
             of cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on species, habitat and communities; and
             (ii) differentiating between risk impacts of anthropogenic sources and climate change
             hazards and describing their interactions (FAO, 2017).

             SUMMARY RESULTS
             Adaptation and risk mitigation are underpinned by common enabling factors: strong
             institutions and good governance, innovation and investments in environmentally
             sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods, and behavioural and
             lifestyle choices. Some of the most important factors shaping the adaptive capacity of
             farmers, households and communities are their access to and control over the natural,
             human, social, physical and financial assets and their ability to use them productively
             (FAO, 2017).
                 Aquaculture can be an adaptation option for other sectors: as an alternative for those
             whose livelihoods are disrupted; a contingency for those whose livelihood assets are
             suddenly diminished by a disaster; for livelihood and farming enterprise diversification;
             and as a productive use of land that has lost its capacity to support crops. In these cases,
             aquaculture can increase income, enhance food security and create jobs.
                 However, there remain important gaps in the science and technology foundation
             for adaptation. More studies are needed on climate change impacts on aquaculture
             crops and on post-production. There is a need to balance studies done on high value
             species in industrialized countries with more focus on tropical species and developing
             countries. Extending research on temperature and acidification to the analysis and
             understanding their social and economic consequences would inform adaptation at
             levels higher than the farm, i.e. household, cooperatives and community. Other gaps
             include the interactions of multiple impacts of climate change on production areas, and
             the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors on aquaculture systems.

             CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             In order to select and implement effectively the strategic measures and technical
             options for adaptation, a number of capacity building measures are recommended:
               1. promote livelihood analysis in aquaculture development planning and project
                  formulation and train planners and development workers on the concept and
                  process of the sustainable livelihoods approach. This ensures people are involved
                  in the choice of adaptation measures and assures the choices are compatible with
                  their livelihood objectives, strategies and assets. The analysis would identify
                  which livelihood capitals need strengthening, how to enable better access to
                  these capitals and increase the ability to manage them, and the role and capacities
                  needed from institutions;
               2. integrate into plans and projects the concept and practice of risk analysis, and
                  strengthen the capacities of organizations in risk analysis and management as the
                  risk impacts along the value chain need to be assessed, communicated and well-
                  managed;
               3. adopt an ecosystem approach to aquaculture (EAA) for integrated and coordinated
                  management of adaptation measures in the aquaculture sector. Such an approach
                  avoids fragmented and isolated efforts. Training on the concept and application
                  of ecosystem-based approaches should be given to disaster risk management
                  personnel; and
               4. check adaptation options, especially the major ones, using feasibility assessments
                  supported by cost—benefit analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Large-river fisheries, like other small-scale fisheries, play a critical role in providing
food security, nutrition, employment, and poverty alleviation (Berkes et al., 2001; Béné
et al., 2007). However, sustainably managing large-river fisheries in South America is
challenging because of increasing fishing pressure, anthropogenic impacts (Barletta
et al., 2010 and 2016), and climate change impacts. La Plata River basin, the second
largest in South America and the fifth largest in the world, represents a case study
that demonstrates the conceptual problems in improving small-scale fluvial fisheries
adaptation and reducing vulnerability to climate change. In the La Plata River basin,
the adaptation of riverine communities to climate change has been poorly considered
by government agendas. Understanding the vulnerability of river fisheries to climate
change is not simple but river fisheries nevertheless deserve attention because of their
social importance. Predicting hydrological conditions will depend on the balance
between several related factors, such as precipitation, temperature and land use patterns
(Saurral et al., 2006). These effects could be exacerbated by several large dams and large
reservoirs installed in the upper basin in Brazil (Agostinho et al., 2007) that have the
capacity to reduce downstream main channel flows and floodplain area during low
rainfall years. These factors add uncertainty about the real impacts of climate change
on future basin conditions affecting fish and fisheries sustainability.

SUMMARY RESULTS: FRAMING CLIMATE CHANGE FOR LARGE RIVERS
Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change have been assessed using different
approaches (e.g. Adger, 2006; Eakin and Luers, 2006; Fűsell and Klein, 2006; O´Brien
et al., 2007; Brugère and De Young, 2015) but can be summarized in terms of two
main perspectives (Okpara et al., 2016). The traditional framework or biophysical
perspective outlined in the IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 2001 and 2007) is the dominant
approach applied to assess vulnerability to climate change by most government
agencies dealing with climate issues. This “end-point” method focuses on learning
about the physical impacts of natural hazards and relates to the level of susceptibility
that is observed after adaptive capacity is considered (Hopkins, 2014). Vulnerability
is the difference between the adaptive capacity relative to potential impacts given by
104 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             exposure and sensitivity in view of future environmental conditions projected by
             multi-decadal global climate models. Thus, adaptive capacity of a system affects the
             assessed vulnerability to climate change by modulating exposure and sensitivity and
             thus potential impacts (Figure 1).


                                                                 FIGURE 1

                 Source: Modified from O' Brien et al. (2007).




                On the other hand, the “starting point” or “contextual” vulnerability framework
             focuses on past and present socio-economic conditions as the main pillars of vulnerability
             to cope or adapt to changing climate conditions (O´Brien et al., 2007). Vulnerability is
             understood as the present inability of a system to handle changing climate conditions
             and is considered an inherent characteristic of socio-ecological systems generated and
             shaped by multiple factors and processes (Kelly and Adger, 2000). This perspective
             is more centered on the social and economic well-being of society (Dessai and
             Humle, 2004), and emphasizes the current socio-economic determinants as drivers
             of vulnerability instead of focusing only on climatic hazards. Therefore, vulnerability
             can be reduced by modifying or improving the social background conditions in which
             climate change occurs so that individuals and groups can better adapt to changing
             climatic stressors (Fellman, 2013). Thus, both approaches stem from different framings
             of the climate change problem considering different temporal and spatial scales for
             adaptation, vulnerability drivers and policy recommendations.
                Such different approaches could dictate dissimilar visions about how to cope with
             climate change but ultimately they will be context-specific. Inland fisheries are exposed
             to direct and indirect natural and human impacts that take place at different spatial and
             temporal scales across the basins. Although fishing communities have developed the
             capacity to cope with the natural hydrological variability exhibited by large floodplain
Key factors and concepts governing the ability of artisanal fisheries in the La Plata River basin   105




rivers, fragile capitals may undermine the ability of fishers to reduce the exposure to
extreme and extended unfavourable climate events and other stressors. In turn, the
degree of sensitivity will be tied to economic, political, socio-cultural and institutional
factors. In La Plata River basin, for example, fisheries adaptation to climate change
is affected not only by climate hazards and expected future conditions but, more
importantly, by visible barriers related to weak governance, poverty, inequity, poor
health and education conditions, limited access to resources, weak assets, lack of
livelihoods diversification, transboundary resource conflicts and fisheries management
policies, and loss of ecological integrity because of rivers fragmentation (Baigún et al.,
2016). The construction of a chain of dams in this basin could exacerbate the effects
of water stress on poor fishing communities downstream and also upstream because
of migratory species depletion, if fishers´ marginalization and poverty conditions are
not first addressed to enhance adaptive processes. Similarly, access to technological
measures, such as aquaculture development to mitigate unfavourable fisheries scenarios,
could have low effectiveness if fishers lack basic services and education, or do not
own their land. Thus, current contextual conditions appear to strongly influence the
exposure and sensitivity to pervasive factors and limit the adaptive capacity to reduce
vulnerability under the “end point” framework.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although river fishing communities systems have developed adaptive management
strategies and have become resilient to dynamic environmental conditions usually
exhibited by large floodplain rivers, a more holistic perspective is necessary to predict
future vulnerability. This needs to be based on understanding the set of underlying
key environmental, social, political, institutional and cultural factors that can exert a
strong influence on fisheries adaptive capacity. Therefore, as climate change adaptation
is rooted in a complex set of factors some authors have called to modify the traditional
IPCC framework to a more comprehensive and integrative framework (Fellman,
2004; Eakin and Luers, 2006; Marshall et al., 2010; Cinner et al., 2013; Johnson and
Welch, 2016; Johnson et al., 2016). These authors recognize that addressing future
vulnerability conditions and approaches are context specific and need to incorporate
the suite of factors that shape socio-ecological systems and enhance their resilience
to adapt to future socio-economic and environmental changes under various climatic
scenarios.
    However, successful climate change adaptation and vulnerability assessment in
large river fisheries needs also to be linked and supported by a shift in management
approach. Whereas the capacity of conventional management systems to adapt to
climate change impacts have been considered low (Badjeck et al., 2009), the application
of an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries (EAF) (De Young et al., 2008) encourages
more participatory policies, and better governance mechanisms. The EAF approach
also strengthens the concept that fluvial fisheries represent valuable ecosystem services
that help reduce poverty and marginalization and provide livelihoods instead of being
considered only as commodities (Baigún et al., 2013). This framework also has the
ability to improve adaptive capacity by encouraging innovative fisheries management
alternatives that benefit the most vulnerable fisheries sectors. In river fisheries, as in
other socio-ecological systems, adaptive capacity may be heterogeneous according to
location, gender, health and social status (Adger et al., 2007). Thus, a potential advantage
of the contextual approach is supported by the strong involvement of communities and
stakeholders in identifying climate change stresses, impacts and adaptation strategies
(Fellman, 2013), all actions that align with EAF principles. This combined vision
would be better suited to enhance the resilience of fishing communities, support their
livelihoods and maintain key ecosystem services in large floodplain rivers.

INTRODUCTION
In the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, fisheries and aquaculture play an important
role in food supply, food security, income generation and export earnings. According to
Allison et al. (2009), the country ranks 12th among countries that are most vulnerable
to climate change impacts on fisheries. Chapainawabganj is one of the most vulnerable
districts of northwest Bangladesh to climate change impacts, particularly increasing
drought, on fisheries and aquaculture (Islam et al. this volume). Kole fish culture
is a non-traditional and recent intervention that offers a climate change adaptation
opportunity, especially to support livelihoods for fishers of northwest Bangladesh. Kole
are small lakes or large ponds that are found in vast areas of the riverbed when the flow
of the Padma River is significantly reduced each dry season, but anthropogenic causes
also play a part. These kole, hereafter referred to as river ponds or, more simply, ponds,
are not flooded for five or six months until the wet season begins, and offer trapped
water that can be used for aquaculture. In recent years, unemployed fishers and youths
near these river ponds have started culturing fish in large ponds in Chapainawabganj
District. River pond fish culture started in 2010 in an unorganized manner by local
fishers in the dry season when fishing options became limited. Thereafter, increasing
numbers of fishers became involved in river pond fish culture as a part-time income
generating activity. A preliminary investigation was carried out to assess the feasibility
of this type of fish culture as a climate change adaptation initiated by fishers and to
identify challenges and future opportunities.

METHODS
Surveys were conducted at three selected ponds in the Padma River of Sadar upazila
(sub-district) in Chapainawabganj District. The first survey was done during January
to July 2012, and repeated in January to July 2015 to re-examine practices and harvests.
The surveys were done using a structured questionnaire. Selected local groups kept all
records of the fish culture operations to inform the study. Each group consisted of 5
to 20 members. Personal interviews and focus group discussions were conducted in
each pond area with voluntary members participating. Information gathered during
the surveys included: pond inputs, stocking, post-stocking management, harvesting
and marketing, labour, expenditure and income, and identified risks. Focus group
discussions recorded the future potential, challenges and sustainability of river pond

                    fish culture, conflicts of interest among stakeholders, and validation of data obtained
                    from the surveys. A total of six focus group discussion sessions were held with 5 to 14
                    members of each group present. No females participated in either the surveys or focus
                    group discussions, as women are not directly engaged in river pond fish culture, but
                    will be specifically included in future surveys. Targeted interviews were also conducted
                    with two field staff from the local fisheries office as key informants to validate the data
                    gathered. Wild fish specimens were collected and brought to the local office of the
                    Department of Fisheries for identification.

                    SUMMARY RESULTS
                    The ownership of river ponds lies with the Ministry of Land and is controlled by the
                    local Sub-district Executive Officer. Sub-district fisheries officers facilitate temporary
                    permission from the Sub-District Executive Officer for fisher groups near ponds
                    to stock fingerlings and farm fish in the pond. River pond fish culture is normally
                    undertaken by a group of 5 to 40 local fishers residing near the pond.

                    Physical features of river ponds: Usually ponds begin to appear in November to
                    December each year (Figure 1), and initially they have a large area (e.g. 15 ha) and are
                    deep (> 4 m). Gradually the ponds become smaller and shallower as conditions become
                    drier. The initial area of the biggest pond surveyed was 15.0 ha, which gradually shrank
                    to 7.4 ha. The smallest pond was 3.5 ha, which finally became 2.5 ha.


                                                                                   FIGURE 1
                                                                 Map showing the study area

 border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement




                    Fish production: Stocking of river ponds usually begins in early January and ends in
                    February. In 2012, fingerling stocking density was 768±266 fingerlings/ha or 320±154
                    kg/ha. In 2015, stocking density had increased to 3 534±1 730 fingerlings/ha or
                    737±460 kg/ha. In most cases, species selection in stocking was done on an ad hoc basis
                    considering the natural food available and preferred by different fish species. Feeding
Kole fish culture: an alternative option for climate change adaptation to support the livelihoods of fishers   111




was also irregular and on an ad hoc basis. Fish harvesting and marketing was usually
done in June to July, and takes two or three weeks to complete. To reduce the risk of
fish escaping because of unexpected early monsoon and inundation, partial harvesting
from May is a common practice. In 2012, the average fish production was 767±447 kg/
ha including 42±31 kg wild fish and in 2015, the average fish production recorded was
2235±970 kg/ha including 82±15 kg wild fish. This production level was found to be
within the average range of fish production from pond aquaculture, which is 4.3 MT/ha
(DoF, 2015). A total of 49 wild fish species, including two prawn species, were recorded
in this study.

Socio-economic and environmental aspects: In the dry season, about 50 percent of
aquaculture river ponds in the Chapainawabganj District suffer from water scarcity,
reduced water depth and about 10 percent of ponds become completely dry (personal
observation). Ponds provide an alternative farming option during dry periods, and can
also be used for raising carp fingerlings early in the fry-rearing season when most of
the nursery ponds lack the quantity of water required. It is estimated that about 100 to
125 ponds with a total water area of about 2 000 ha appear each year in the Padma River
basin in northwest of the country. These waterbodies present significant potential for
additional fish farming and livelihoods, with current annual production of 1 500 to
4 000 MT using traditional culture practices that can be increased to 6 000 to 8 000 MT
worth USD 15–20 million if improved technology is adopted. About 2 500–3 000
people can be engaged in river pond fish culture, representing 75 percent to 90 percent
of fishers whose livelihoods become vulnerable during dry periods.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The contribution from inland fisheries to the country’s total fish production is gradually
declining as a result of climate change impacts on rainfall and water supply, which is
affecting food security and livelihoods. The river ponds offer a new opportunity for
seasonal fish culture to support fishers’ livelihoods during dry periods. River drying
and limited fishing scope in the dry season is now a regular phenomenon that has
prompted fishers to initiate fish farming in river ponds as an alternative livelihood
option and has future potential as a climate change adaptation.

The use of water lettuce
(Pistia stratiotes) for lowering
water temperature of freshwater
ponds with the black-chin tilapia
(Sarotherodon melanotheron)

ABSTRACT
The effects of the water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes) as a floating plant to reduce water
temperature of freshwater ponds and the growth of the black-chin tilapia (Sarotherodon
melanotheron) were determined. Two densities of the plant contained by floating
PVC pipes were tested (12 percent and 24 percent of pond water surface). The results
showed that the mean water temperature (max-min/day) of the pond with 24 percent
shading of the plant was lower by 3.2o C compared to that of the control pond (without
shading), whereas that of the pond with 12 percent shading was reduced by only 1.5o C.
The fish in the pond with 24 percent shading grew at 0.59 g/day compared to -0.12 g/day
for fish in the pond with 12 percent shading after 32 culture days. This indicates that
the lower water temperature in the pond with 24 percent plant cover favoured the
growth of fish despite the lower levels of pH and dissolved oxygen and higher water
transparency compared to the control pond. Further studies are recommended to
determine the cost-effectiveness of the use of the plant as well as its other benefits for
growing fish in aquaculture ponds as a coping strategy for climate change.

INTRODUCTION
Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic plants and animals, is vulnerable to the adverse
impacts of changing climate. In the Republic of Philippines, brackish aquaculture
ponds and seaweed culture in open coastal waters sustained the biggest losses because
of the El Niño event of 1997-1998 that caused high surface temperatures and drought
(PCAMRD, 1999). One of the coping strategies for reducing water temperature of
aquaculture ponds is the use of artificial shading material, such as fine-mesh nylon
netting. The prohibitive cost of such material, however, limits its use by small-scale
farmers.
   The water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), a floating aquatic weed that is common in
freshwater lakes and rivers of tropical countries such as the Republic of Philippines,
was reported by Attionu (1976) to reduce water temperature by lessening sunlight
penetration in open freshwater systems. According to Akinbile and Suffian (2012),
the roots of the plant absorb ammonia, nitrates, metals and phosphates, and provide
oxygen. Moreover, they also stated that the plant shades the ponds from light and
prevents overheating of the pond water.
   This study was conducted in April-May 2016 at the height of the El Niño episode
in Bay, Laguna, the Republic of Philippines and determined the effects of (P. stratiotes)

             shading on lowering the water temperature of freshwater ponds and on the growth of
             the black-chin tilapia (Sarotherodon melanotheron).

             METHODS
             Two shading densities of P. stratiotes were tested (12 percent and 24 percent of pond
             water surface) within each of two 200 m2 ponds (mean depth of 0.75 m) supplied by
             a freshwater irrigation source. The ponds were fertilized with vermicompost (organic
             fertilizer) at 1 ton/ha.
                P. stratiotes was contained at the pond surface by floating frames made up of 5 cm
             diameter polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipes. Three floating frames for the plant with a
             total area of 28 m2 were used in one pond and six floating frames with a total area
             of 56 m2 in a second pond. In each pond, 120 male S. melanotheron with 100 g mean
             weight were stocked. A 200 m2 pond without the plant and fish was used as the control.
                Water temperature readings were taken in the ponds with a Taylor Maximum/
             Minimum Thermometer. Water quality parameters for pH (Tetratest), transparency
             (Secchi disk) and dissolved oxygen (YSI metre) were measured. The mean weights of
             the fish were measured after 32 days of culture to determine their growth rate.

             SUMMARY RESULTS
             The results (Table 1) showed that the mean of the max-min water temperature readings
             for the pond with six frames of the plant was 3.2o C lower than that of the control pond,
             whereas the mean temperature for the pond with three frames was only 1.5o C lower
             than the control. These results indicated that the six frames of the plant were more
             effective in lowering pond water temperature than the three frames. The dissolved
             oxygen and pH levels were lower and the transparency of the water was higher in the
             pond with six frames compared to those in the control pond.

                The growth of the fish in the pond with 24 percent shading was faster than that
             of fish in the pond with 12 percent shade that actually lost weight (Table 2). The
             tolerable water temperature range for pond culture of tilapias is 28–32o C. The results
             showed that the lower water temperature in the pond with 24 percent shade was more
             favourable for fish growth. This and other possible benefits of the plant should be
             studied further.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The water lettuce (P. stratiotes) was effective in lowering pond water temperature by
3.2o C, which contributed to faster growth of S. melanotheron. The growth of fish in
the pond with 12 percent shading where water temperature was lowered by 1.5o C
was negative. Further studies are recommended to determine the cost-effectiveness of
the use of the plant and its other benefits in aquaculture ponds for growing fish as an
adaptation to climate change-induced pond temperature increases.

INTRODUCTION
It seems unclear whether fishing communities adjust in response to actual or expected
climatic change in a particularly different way than they adapt to other types of
variability and hazards. However, addressing climate risks, enhancing adaptive
capacity and reducing vulnerability are currently important aims in development
plans for the fisheries and aquaculture sector may not be often covered effectively by
governmental agencies. Here, we report on an ongoing evaluation of the adaptation
continuum (from impacts-focused to vulnerability-focused) as part of the local actions
in Brazil derived from the “Global understanding and learning for local solutions:
reducing the vulnerability of marine-dependent communities” (GULLS) project,
funded by the Belmont Forum and which plans to provide adaptation options in five
countries of the southern hemisphere considered hotspots of ocean warming (Cochrane
et al., 2014; Hobday et al., 2016). The aim of this paper is to share key local views on
the construction of adaptation plans in fishing communities (and industries) in Brazil,
applicable also to a regional level.
    The way that cultures adapt and react to environmental and climate change differs
significantly around the globe and adaptation-driven innovation is developing in
several different ways in distinct communities and societies. It is, therefore, particularly
important to develop context-specific adaptation plans rather than generalized or
global approaches.
    The concept of “adaptation” applies to both natural and social sciences, referring
in both cases to three key processes: flexibility, acclimatization and learning. The way
each culture develops those three processes may also differ as innovation arises from
diversity and exchange. In this sense, adaptation can be seen as a process, action or
outcome of a system to better cope with, manage or adjust to changing conditions,
stresses, hazards, risks and opportunities, and to enhance the fitness and survival
of individuals (natural sciences) or a society (social sciences) at the local level. We
argue that the responses to climate change exposure in fishing communities, being
characterized as coping or adapting (Box 1), deserve context-specific adaptation plans
rather than “all-fits-one” general approaches. However, outcomes from central places
(sensu Gasalla and Tutui, 2002), such as science-based forecasting and assessments may
not be disregarded and should contribute as guidance on the perspectives of further
change.

             METHODS
             In GULLS - Brazilian section, climate change impacts have been assessed through
             different sources and innovative approaches, including bottom-up surveys within fishing
             communities (Martins and Gasalla, 2018a), the application of the “ethno-oceanographic
             framework” (Gasalla and Diegues, 2011; Martins and Gasalla, 2018b), vulnerability
             analyses (Aswani et al. 2018; Martins and Gasalla, 2018b), the downscaling of global/
             regional ocean models (Popova et al., 2016) and some stock assessment modelling,
             education and policy mapping (e.g. Hobday et al., 2016).
                Below we describe a strategy in which these science-based outcomes are incorporated
             into participatory methods to identify adaptation options (Figure 1). The idea is
             to combine local knowledge with scientific data, in a process of builds on people’s
             understanding about climate risks and adaptation strategies, and by providing dialogue
             and knowledge exchange within communities of practice.
                The adaptation design process includes 1) the analysis of current exposure and
             impacts of climate change; 2) a model-based analysis of future climate scenarios;
             3) understanding of individuals, households, and communities vulnerability, as well
             as the engagement of multiple stakeholders; and, 4) the effective sharing of knowledge
             and lessons learned.

   Community, household, and individual adaptation to climate change is being
facilitated by the extent to which local people are ‘experiencing climate change’,
are ‘knowledgeable about climate change’, and are able to change their behavior to
‘actively manage risks’ (Bennett et al., 2014). Our methodological approach follows the
adaptation continuum (Figure 2), and the following steps (in Box 2) are applied into
the co-production of an adaptation plan to climate change in fishing communities and
industries. The scientific counterpart included in the stepwise method above is based in
a set of working groups in which the GULLS research has being organized (Figure 3).

             SUMMARY RESULTS
             Coastal fishing communities have shown their own perspectives, which allow to
             build on both extremes of the adaptation continuum. Martins and Gasalla (2018a)
             shows an application of the ethno-oceanographic approach to climate change in
             Brazilian fishing communities, which highlights main perceptions found and eventual
             alternative scientific confirmations and hypotheses. The study of stakeholders’
             perceptions seems to empower fishing communities in a way that their perspectives
             are taken into account and linked to the science produced; finding a place where
             their innovations may be enhanced, validated, stimulated and contextualized. On the
             other hand, the outcomes of a series of scientific working groups currently running
             specific science-oriented analyses (Figure 3) with local and international teams is being
             presented to selected fishing communities where participatory approaches will allow
             the co-production of local adaptation plans and strategies to current climate change
             challenges.
                Climate change impacts have been explored in different ways (Aswani et al., 2018;
             Gasalla et al., 2018; Martins and Gasalla, 2018a,b; Popova et al., 2016) and should be
             taken into account in this process, especially in the small-scale sector (Gasalla and
             Castro, 2016). The co-production of an adaptation plan following Box 2 seems to be a
             promising strategy at the country (and regional) level.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Regional adaption plans may be co-produced between science and local users and
innovation-based solutions found at the community level should be emphasized.
Respecting the numerous geographical, economic and cultural peculiarities of the
heterogeneous coastline area of Brazil is key if aiming to moderate harm or exploiting
beneficial opportunities to the sector.
   Participatory methods provide opportunities to link community knowledge to
available scientific information on climate change and oceans. Our method and results
tend to provide a solid foundation for the discussion of practical strategies exploring
innovation and will facilitate both policy formulation and community-based adaptation
to climate change in Brazilian fishing communities.
   Current actions are helping the sector to better understand the implications of
climate change on their livelihoods, as well as to support researchers refining local data
and model downscaling. GULLS-Brazil should trigger climate change adaptation-
driven innovation and self-empowerment and this local understanding and learning I
also key to global solutions.

ABSTRACT
Indigenous communities of northeast India remain isolated from the mainland and
live in a distinct cultural setting with their environment. Because of their high degree
of exposure to and connections with the environment, they have rich traditional
knowledge about predicting and adapting to climate change. We accessed and illustrated
the traditional knowledge on fish and fisheries from the region through a participatory
rural appraisal (PRA) approach. Our study revealed that ecological and climatic
circumstances are maintained through the traditional system of governance and local
self-government. Local skills, tools, techniques, wisdom, beliefs and customs of the
Indigenous people act as a buffer during disasters and successfully build resilience to
climate hazards. Most of this knowledge was transferred over successive generations
and has become a part of living, cultural and religious sustenance. Adaptation strategies
at the community level for fisheries help to reduce vulnerabilities to extreme weather,
such as drought, floods, and unpredictable rainfall patterns. Adaptation to climate
change in fisheries is delivered through strategies at fine-scale spatial and grassroots
levels. Mainstreaming climate change adaptation efforts can only be achieved through
extensive assessment, research, recognition, and promotion of local skills, culture,
Indigenous knowledge and community-based fisheries.

INTRODUCTION
To investigate the key areas of climate change, the research community needs to
improve its understanding of the complex interaction between humans and their
ecosystems, especially including climate features (Moss et al., 2010). Perceptions of
climate change, risks, responses, and adaptation depend not only on external legitimacy
but also on the inner cognitive feelings and emotional processes of the observers. For a
better understanding of climate change, scientific research needs to be ground-truthed
by integrating its results with traditional knowledge systems (Usher, 2000; Riedlinger
and Berkes, 2001). Consequently, decision-makers increasingly recognize the intuitive
thinking processes of Indigenous people as key aspects of climate change knowledge.
Indigenous people’s proximity to nature and their total dependence on local resources
gives them better insight into changes on the ground and the strategies they use to
protect themselves and adapt to any changes are important elements of traditional
knowledge. This knowledge can be integrated into resource management systems and
assist in broader climate change adaptation strategies.
   Scientific study, research and policy formulation efforts have been made in
responding and adapting to climate change. Although scientific communities undertake
126 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             their research at broad spatial scales, and often over decades, the hazards of climate
             change are expressed quickly at the local level. Although IPCC has assessed a wide
             range of technical, economic and institutional elements, an effective and appropriate
             framework for the subsistence economy and traditional tenure systems has not yet
             been developed (Klein and Nicholls, 1999). The local and traditional knowledge base
             can be used to help refine assessments of the adaptive capacity of climate change
             in fisheries. This will require an intensive assessment of information from marginal
             people still living in Indigenous cultures that coexist with aquatic environments. Their
             approaches in responding and adapting to climate and climate change need to be
             evaluated. How is their society able to link with the local ecosystem and how do they
             respond to changes? In addition, scientific views need to be framed and interpreted at
             local scales. In many parts of the Republic of India, Indigenous knowledge of climate
             can be traced to relatively inaccessible areas where communities typically have been
             settled for a long time.
                The status of knowledge, however, is influenced by modern changes that may erode
             and disrupt the spontaneous viable linkages of people and nature. Communities of the
             eastern Himalayas, particularly northeast India, remain isolated from the mainland
             of the Republic of India (Verma, 1995) and thus they live in a distinct cultural setting
             within a complex sphere of interacting with the environment. In considering climate
             change adaptation options, knowledge of local assessments, conservation practices, and
             traditional resource-use systems and techniques in such areas can improve adaptation
             strategies. The majority of the people are small-scale artisanal fishers and they practice
             community-based fisheries resources management. These communities may possess a
             rich knowledge of the variables used in perceiving and predicting climate. Therefore,
             the present study was undertaken to assess the indigenous knowledge of aquatic
             resources utilization and to link it with socio-ecological resilience to climate change.
             The present paper aims to characterize the available indigenous tools, techniques, and
             wisdom for sustainable fisheries in the context of climatic hazards. The study proposed
             to establish the pathway in which indigenous knowledge systems simultaneously
             achieve climate change adaptation and offset climate impacts.

             METHODS
             The study was conducted in northeast India in an area situated at 21° 57’ N – 29°
             30’ N and 89°46’ E – 97° 30’ E. The region hosts more than 130 tribal communities
             (Census of India, 2011) and the populations in 6 699 villages comprise 100 percent
             tribal peoples (Government of India, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 2013). Preliminary
             screening and identification of the communities/ethnic groups were made based on
             livelihoods and the value they placed on traditional aquatic resources. Potential “target
             ethnic groups” were chosen as the key informants for the assessment of traditional
             knowledge systems. A total of 78 districts were selected and grouped into 20 sub-
             zones. Two to four villages from each sub-zone (a total of 53 villages) were chosen
             for investigation. A total of 371 community members were selected as respondents on
             the basis of simple random sampling. However, questionnaires and discussions with
             fishers, farmers, traditional healers, village headmen, the local priest and other elder
             indigenous community members were also part of the study. We accessed local skills,
             tools, techniques, wisdom, customs, and beliefs on fish and fisheries and coupled this
             with climate response and adaptive approaches. Participatory rural appraisal (PRA)
             tools were applied by holding dialogues and conversations with the respondents in
             the form of semi-structured interviews. Data from the interviews were categorized
             and examined to gain an understanding of perceptions on climate change and climatic
             hazards, and to depict the adaptive mechanisms for short-term as well as long-term
             climate variability.

SUMMARY RESULTS
The northeast region of the Republic of India is inhabited by a fairly homogenous
set of ethnic groups surviving as mutually exclusive traditional societies. Most
ethnic groups, including tribal communities, exhibit a similar pattern in terms of
their subsistence, culture, economic and ecological appraisals. Cultivators remain
poor, and their livelihoods still depend on natural resources. The majority of the
poor people rely on dwindling aquatic resources and operate primitive methods of
agriculture. In this study, 92 percent of the respondents possessed unique traditional
knowledge with particular reference to the aquatic environment. It included novel
folk technologies, tools, techniques, wisdom, rituals, beliefs and other institutional
arrangements (Table 1). The respondents reported their perceptions of climate change
and the strategies used to adapt to climate variations, which were predominantly based
on ensuring their continued use of aquatic resources. The researchers classified the
elements of traditional knowledge systems reported into three categories: perception;
prediction; and adaptation to or coping with climate variability.

1.       Perception of climate change and climatic hazards
In the assessment and exploration of the perceptions of indigenous people, 87 percent of
the respondents agreed that climate was changing and stated that they had experienced
climatic hazards. The prominent indicators identified during the survey in the context
of climate change for fisheries were:
    I.     increased intensity, frequency and severity of extreme weather;
    II.    erratic rainfall pattern or unreliable monsoon;
    III. more floods, higher intensity of monsoon winds;
    IV. larger storms causing structural damage to ponds, and loss of fisheries
           stocks;
    V.     decreased endemic or local fish species;
    VI. extreme drought, reduced water retention period and reduced fish yield;
    VII. increased spread of vector-borne diseases;
    VIII. reduced water quality, appearance of fish diseases and parasites;
    IX. changes in species composition and fishing efforts affected by changes in
           biogeography of species;
    X.     declining catch from the wild and lower stock abundance leading to
           decreased revenue;
    XI. changed post-harvest and processing costs and technology because of longer
           cloudy and rainy periods;
    XII. impact on marketing and transportation because of frequent floods and hot
           dry periods;
    XIII. impact on socio-economic conditions and pressure on livelihoods; and
    XIV. effects on small-scale fisher folks including fish processors and ancillary
           workers.

2.      Prediction or forecasts of weather and climatic variability
Surprisingly, 57 percent of respondents stated that they were competent in weather
and climate forecasting or prediction. They perceived that sudden changes in the
behaviour or appearance of insects, plants or animals were linked to irregular extreme
weather. For example, if a large group of Reticulitermes insects, a group of termites,
comes out of the soil during the monsoon season, this predicts that the rain will stop
for a few days. Similar predications were scientifically proven for the potato aphid
(Macrosiphum euphorbiae) that reduced their sexual behaviour in response to the drop
in atmospheric pressure that precedes rain (Owens, 2013). People also predict rain by
observing the unusual behaviour of the Jungle Owlet (Glaucidium sp.). This owlet
chirps and beats its wings on the ground a few hours before rain. If frogs (Rana sp.)

thicker webs, also predicts rain. The early flowering and larger bud size of the night-

3.       Adaptation to and coping with climate change
In the survey, diverse forms of indigenous knowledge including tools, techniques,
traditions, customs, beliefs and traditional co-operative management practices were
recalled that are directly or indirectly associated with adapting to climate change. Most
of the local skills and indigenous technical knowledge were delicate and highly sensitive
to the changing behavior of aquatic ecosystems. They strengthened ecosystem–societal
links by producing resource-friendly traditional management systems or techniques.
Almost all the fishing gears and crafts were made of bamboo by using specialized
techniques. Sometimes the limitations of resource extraction intensity were balanced
by establishing local autonomous systems to maintain the needs for subsistence.
About 90 percent of the knowledge or techniques available appeared to be directly or
indirectly related to resilience to climate change, but this requires scientific validation.
Seventy-one percent of respondents confirmed their involvement in community-based
fisheries. Their adaptation and coping mechanisms can be classified into: co-operative
strategies; traditions and customs; culture and beliefs; wisdom; tools and techniques.

             CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             Humans and their environment are intimately related in many Indigenous cultures. An
             intricate web of interchange comprising expropriation and manipulation characterizes
             the connections and flow of resources. Such interactions are multifaceted and have
             arisen spontaneously, rather than by planned and/or explicit paths. Regardless of
             economic, ethnic or political positions, people settled near forests and centres of
             crop origin have a common interest in maintaining their ecological resources. Such
             areas tend to be isolated physically, politically and economically from policy and
             development planners (Lipton, 1979). Animism and other autochthonous cultures
             surviving in indigenous communities of northeast India can provide knowledge on
             how human and non-human entities interact within the environment. These systems
             create close linkages between natural processes and community practices. The linkages
             value the true legacy of coexistence between biological resources and human heritage.
             In these systems, resource control and a one-dimensional flow of benefits are rare.
                If the resource users are in close proximity and have a critical dependence on healthy
             and functioning natural resources, an intuitive or ecological basis of resource system
             management has been shown to evolve spontaneously (Ellen, 1981). Indigenous or
             aboriginal people settled in isolated remote locations often maintain such systemic
             knowledge. Social anthropologists consider the northeast region of India a cultural
             hotspot because of the existence of diverse ethnic groups and sub-groups or tribes and
             sub-tribes. More than 200 ethnic groups live there and many of them are still forest
             dwellers following animistic beliefs. The Indigenous people of the region possess great
Building socio-ecological resilience to climate change for fisheries through local skill and indigenous knowledge   131




knowledge of plants, animals, and natural phenomena. They are intricately associated
with the environment in which they live. Thus they possess a rich knowledge of social
level “intuitive” thought. Many of the communities have a physical and spiritual
relationship with the environment and secure their livelihoods on the basis of a
functional knowledge of it. They have had a long time for informal experimentation
based on their understanding and intuitions of the resources and their availability. The
indicators that enable the people to make predictions are based on the development of
plants and the behavior of animals in their local environments, and these predictions have
been gradually incorporated into traditional ceremonies and religious faiths. Usually,
traditional people recognized such manifestations of environmental dynamics in terms of
a myriad of opportunities and limitations for the survival of the community. The majority
of the tribal populations of northeast India live in the forests, and their livelihoods
depend on the aquatic resources. Their economy is of primitive character and the society
is predominantly agrarian. Sometimes, they live on small islands permanently in the
middle of lakes. As an example, dwellers on the island of Loktak Lake, Manipur (1 100
households) settled either permanently or temporarily on the Phumdis (heterogeneous
mass of vegetation and organic matter) long ago and made small huts to live in.
   They are not only keen observers of the change in the aquatic environment but
also vigorously predict and adapt to the changes. They manage the ecosystems based
on cultural and religious beliefs. Lai Haraoba (merit making ceremonies associated
with Meitei deities) in Meitei communities and Law Kyntang (sacred forest) of the
Khasi tribes are two examples of the autochthonous cultures that have coexisted with
resource exploitation for a long time. Lai Haraoba is the indigenous ritual performed
every year by Meitei communities, for the strength, prosperity and health of the village.

and ask the oracles about the village’s fate and predict disasters for the upcoming year.
   The indigenous fisherfolk have adapted traditional tools for food security and
income generation. The fishers are mostly small-scale artisanal fishers and they use
community-based fisheries approaches. These tools and techniques have also facilitated
women to participate in fisheries related activities (Inaotombi and Mahanta, 2016) that
are essential to ensure a socio-ecological balance. The innovations for fish and fisheries
have been created and held by the indigenous people over successive generations.
Such wisdom helps in building adaptive or coping mechanisms that the people are
executing to cope with short-term climatic variability. Indigenous knowledge and
local skills are used as key elements for survival, sustainable yields and have increased
the potential range of adaptation options to climate hazards for fisheries. These tools
and techniques (including gears and crafts) enable people to tackle the risks of climate
change. Local skills and tools act as buffers during disasters and successfully build-in
climatic resilience. Scientific and formal research needs to recognize and incorporate
these local tools and techniques.
   Determinants of adaptive capacity within communities co-evolved with changes
in the physical environment (Dolan and Walker, 2016). The forest and other
environmental entities are closely associated with and valued by the community as
a whole. Because of high social cohesiveness, indigenous people of northeast India
develop local control systems through group action with respect to sanctions and
facilities governing resource utilization. Organized communities are highly engaged
in decision-making about resource use and may improve adaptation attitudes towards
climatic variables. Thus, recognition of community-based fisheries management can
help in bringing positive socio-ecological linkages through strengthening traditional
institutional mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to ground-truth research at the
community level and include the knowledge systems of indigenous peoples.
   Societal adaptation to the environment evolves by rationing resources, diversifying
usage and needs, or transforming resources to meet the demand (Berkes, 1989; Devis,
132 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             1993). For example, Katal or Jeng is the transformation of a waterbody by erecting or
             planting patches of weeds as fish habitat. Transforming natural resources on the basis
             of meeting human demands needs to be appropriate and based on the attributes of the
             available natural resources (Jochim, 2013; Gadgil and Berkes, 1991). The responses of
             traditional societies of northeast India depend upon the characteristics of the resources
             as well as the socio-economic obligations of the villagers. When the changes concern
             local scarcities, the mechanisms for revitalizing the resource system involves collective
             protection and regulated use. Indigenous people settling in isolated areas are privileged
             to have political independence. Limiting the pressure of demand on resources and the
             extraction intensity in keeping with subsistence needs was achieved by establishing
             local autonomy systems. From adult suffrage or clans, representatives of village
             councils or headmen of autocracies were elected to safeguard customs and ways of
             life. Control and management of various waterbodies including rivers, ponds and lakes
             was achieved through the traditional systems of governance and local self-government.
             Logically, the indigenous people developed their political systems through social
             evolution. This traditional autonomy in the management of indigenous people’s affairs
             was recognized and protected under the sixth schedule of the Constitution of India
             (article 244 (2) & Article 275(1)).
                 The rules of resource management are usually seasonally specific and they evolved
             efficiently as a result of the different perceptions and values of the decision-makers
             and resource users. These rules were incorporated into customary law or became part
             of the culture and belief system of the indigenous people (Figure 2). Adopted norms
             and practices are greatly influenced by the circumstances and features of biophysical
             resources (Jochim, 2013). Traditional fishing guidelines also evolved as rules and
             regulations for the community and the individual’s behaviour vis-à-vis nature. They
             became a custom of the community when the majority of the members adopted
             the practices. Such customary laws maintained and stabilized the social order when
             transmitted from one generation to another (Singh, 1993). They were also integrated
             into religious beliefs and rituals (Figure 2). Such laws are usually created by numerous
             unwritten usages, and thus much data are still unavailable. There is a concern for the

                                                         FIGURE 2

permanent loss or fossilization of such traditional knowledge from the region. This
precious knowledge and the traditional techniques need to be documented, protected
and promoted for future uses.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Formally, indigenous knowledge has been gradually recognized as a form of rational
and reliable information and has acquired equal status with scientific knowledge
(UNEP, 1998). Local skills and indigenous knowledge are not only pragmatic and
sensible but are also cost-effective and sustainable. It is therefore of utmost importance
to involve Indigenous people and communities in decision-making, planning and
management. Their knowledge could aid in building a strong foundation for effective
research design and implementation of climate change adaptations. Adaptation to
climatic hazards can be interpreted through strategies available from the fine-scale
spatial and grassroots techniques evolved by indigenous people. The focus should be
shifted to local-level capacities that deal with institutional frameworks that govern
decisions at different scales. The bottom-up approach needs to be established by
re-orientating the whole process of project planning, design and implementation. In
various parts of the world, there is concern for the permanent loss or fossilization of
such valuable knowledge. Current scientific knowledge should allow such knowledge
to be tendered and adopted for technical solutions that fit within adaptation strategies
rather than to deny this potential content and the systems within which it has evolved.
Mainstreaming of climate change adaptation efforts can only be achieved by extensive
assessment and research with emphasis on conservation of indigenous knowledge.

ABSTRACT
Natural hazards have become a way of life in the Republic of the Philippines. The well-
being of socially-disadvantaged agricultural and coastal communities depends on how
relief budgets for floods and other disasters are managed. The paper presents a case in
the Central Philippines to examine actual disaster spending of households, legislation
for disasters, and the role of non-government organizations (NGOs) in disaster relief.
The Central Philippines is a disaster-vulnerable region known for its diverse marine
ecosystems and its strong fisheries industry but its disaster funds are either misdirected
or limited. The paper focuses on an exploratory analysis of disaster expenditure
and legislation for effective disaster planning. Using 192 geographically selected
households from one agricultural town and one coastal town in Central Philippines,
findings revealed that although strong disaster legislation may lead to minimum flood
damage, the level of spending does not determine flood impacts. It is postulated that
the implementation of legislation, including monitoring and support from NGOs or
other civil organizations, is essential in reducing local disaster vulnerability. This is
especially true in coastal communities in the town of Oton where strong collaboration
with NGOs is prevalent. NGOs in the case study area, as front-line institutions for
disaster response, have strong involvement in community-based disaster management,
which includes planning and capacity building, advocacy, and influencing legislation
for disaster prevention.

INTRODUCTION
Disasters are disruptions of a community at any scale brought about by hazardous
events interacting with conditions of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity,
which lead to human, material, economic, and environmental losses (UNISDR, 2007).
Flooding is a natural occurrence where bodies of water such as rivers overflow to land
areas that are not usually submerged (Jah et al., 2012) and is one of the most common
disasters in the Republic of the Philippines. Traditionally, floods are triggered by the
interaction between hydrological and meteorological factors (altitude, precipitation,
and snowmelt) (De Moel and Aerts, 2011). As such, flood damage models often use
hydrological data (e.g. rainfall volume) to predict flood characteristics (e.g. speed and
velocity) (see Pistrika and Jonkman, 2010; Jongman et al., 2012). However, social and
economic factors, such as poverty and gender, also influence disaster vulnerability
(Wisner et al., 2004), as well as deforestation and non-compliance with infrastructure
regulations (Bankoff and Hilhorst, 2009). Therefore, in recent years, there has been
increasing interest in understanding the social science of floods.

                Disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) involves mitigation, prevention,
             preparedness, rehabilitation, and response. In the Republic of the Philippines, poor
             households are highly dependent on their natural resources (e.g. coasts and rivers) and
             they often (illegally) settle near these assets to have easy access to food or livelihood
             opportunities. Aside from the economic and social pressures, disasters adversely affect
             day-to-day activities, for example, catching fish, weaving nets, washing clothes, and
             attending school. Therefore, the well-being of socially disadvantaged households along
             coasts/rivers and farms partly depends on how well they adapt to risks and mitigate
             disaster impacts.
                Recent evidence shows that flood-mitigation strategies have been mismanaged
             (Wisner et al., 2004). About 1 106 municipalities (out of 1 500) and 80 cities (out of 117)
             have Disaster Coordinating Councils (DCCs) that are non-functional. Most towns
             focus on limited areas of disaster management, such as preparedness and response
             (Benson, 2009). In addition, multisectoral collaboration remains a challenge because
             actors — government, NGOs, the media and other stakeholders — perceive, prepare,
             manage, and record disasters in different ways. For example, the state and state agencies
             view disasters from a different perspective than that of those who are directly affected.
             Moreover, operations of NGOs that include civil society organizations are dependent
             on their organizations’ ideologies (Bankoff and Hilhorst, 2009). The responses of media
             to disasters relate to the public awareness and humanitarian dimensions. As a result,
             there are differences in the preparation, management, and perceptions of disasters, and
             consequently the levels of disaster impacts.
                This paper highlights three important concepts affecting successful DRRM, namely
             (valuing) flood impacts, disaster legislation, and disaster spending. Legislation/
             regulation is essential in: (1) providing a legal framework for various disaster
             activities; (2) institutionalizing the functions of many (participating) institutions; and
             (3) safeguarding funds for disaster support programmes. More importantly, the paper
             examines NGOs as DRRM agents and emphasizes their roles in disaster mitigation and
             preparedness (Benson, 2009; Islam and Walkerden, 2015). Hence, understanding these
             three areas and NGOs may improve the well-being of fishers and farmers as disaster
             vulnerable groups.

             METHODS
             The Republic of the Philippines, an archipelagic economy in Southeast Asia, is an
             interesting case study area because disasters are common in the country and farming
             and fishing are important yet exposed activities (Bankoff, 2015). An average of 20
             typhoons with associated flooding affect the country each year (ADRC, n.d), and this is
             projected to increase; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) project
             more frequent and/or stronger typhoons in the future (IPCC, 2014). Households in
             agricultural sectors also have low income and poor access to infrastructure support that
             weakens their disaster resiliency. Hence, fishers and farmers experience the greatest
             impacts and welfare losses from disasters, for example, personal injuries, inundation of
             their houses, and damage to fishing boats and gears.
                In order to draw comparisons between the disaster experiences of coastal and
             agricultural residences, we chose a coastal town (Oton) and an agricultural town (Santa
             Barbara) in the Province of Iloilo, in Central Philippines (Figure 1). These areas present
             experiences of disaster-vulnerable and less-developed communities, and their actions
             to minimize disaster impacts. Mitigation and other disaster programmes are usually
             limited, low priority (Benson, 2009), inadequate, and/or unavailable (Iloilo City
             Government, 2012) in these towns. The towns were also selected because of household
             heterogeneity in terms of livelihoods and flood experience and because household-level
             flood damage data are available.

    Oton is a town in southern Iloilo and comprises 37 barangays (or villages) (8 644 ha),
with six of these being coastal. In 2012, the town had a population of 17 315 and fishing
is a major industry. However, declines in fish catches and a longstanding problem with
municipal water boundaries and therefore water supply are two of the main threats in
the municipality.
    Santa Barbara, located 16 km north of Iloilo City (capital of Western Visayas
Region), has 60 barangays (13 196 ha) with 55 472 residents (DILG, 2010). Agriculture
is the main industry, however the town has rapidly industrialized in the last five years.
Future development plans include an eco-adventure park and recreational adventure
tourism, which may adversely impact agricultural lands through rapid conversion of
(rice) farms to various industrial uses.
    According to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean
(ECLAC), disaster impacts are classified into three categories: (1) direct damages
to assets; (2) indirect losses refer to damages incurred after the disaster and extend
throughout the rehabilitation and reconstruction period; and (3) losses from impeding
macro-economic variables such as overall prices.
    Information about monetary flood damages and losses (property/personal damages,
loss of employment opportunities, and additional damages) were collected using
household surveys conducted in July and August 2013 in Oton and Santa Barbara.
Barangays were geographically selected in order to gather and compare information
from households that are near bodies of water (e.g. rivers, creeks and ocean). Six
barangays were selected per town and 16 residents per barangay were interviewed —
with a total sample of 192.13 Secondary sources were also used to gather information
about disaster legislation and expenditure. Documents used include the Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management – Climate Change Action Plan 2012–2016, Executive
Orders (EO), Memorandum of Agreements (MOA), and Local Disaster Risk
Reduction and Management Fund (LDRRMF).14

       In the Philippines, the Republic Act (RA) No. 10121, also known as the Philippine Disaster Risk
       Reduction and Management Plan (DRRM) Act of 2010, provides a mandate to strengthen disaster risk
       reduction and management of the Philippines.

             RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

             Flood monetary damages
             Respondents were asked to identify the losses they experienced from flood incidents in
             the last five years. Results showed that the majority of damages were to property and
             other personal effects, followed by damages because of lost employment opportunities.
             These damages may include the cost of repairs to fishing boats and gear as well as
             foregone income from an inability to fish during typhoons. Other losses included
             additional costs for medical treatment and purchase of clean/safe drinking water (e.g.
             distilled /purified water from water stations).
                The coastal municipality of Oton has a moderate rating for flood damages
             (PHP 1 903), whereas the agricultural town of Santa Barbara has high flood damage
             rating (PHP 3 915). This may be attributed to the differences of property values and
             income levels between coastal and agricultural areas (Cervantes, 2012; NEDA, 2016).
             Thus, households in Santa Barbara have experienced higher flood impacts compared to
             households in Oton.
                However, low (flood) damages do not mean that floods do not affect households.
             Analysis of flood frequency and annual flood damages across income deciles, showed
             that average annual flooding incidents dropped with annual income whereas the mean
             annual flood damage decreases with annual income (Figure 2). These patterns suggest
             that floods affect the wealthy households less compared to the poor households.

             Disaster legislation support
             Disaster legislation in the Republic of the Philippines is multi-level but interdependent.
             Local-level disaster legislation should be congruent with the national disaster policies
             in order to strengthen and build disaster-resilient communities and institutionalize
             procedures and measures for reducing disaster risks.
                Disaster-related legislation was analyzed and categorized according to the level of
             disaster-related legislative support (high, moderate or low). Findings showed that both
             municipalities have high or “strong” legislation support ratings. This means that both
             municipalities enacted and updated their disaster-related legislation and/or guidelines
             before the implementation of the national Republic Act (RA) 10121 (a list of all
             legislation and regulations in both municipalities is in Annex A).
                The municipalities institutionalized their visions of “disaster resilient communities”
             by strengthening “economic, social, infrastructure, institution and environment

sectors” and developing Disaster Risk Reduction and Management – Climate Change
Action (DRRM – CCA) Plans. They also conducted risk assessment and Hazard
Vulnerability Capacity Assessment (HVCA) to determine disaster benchmarks and to
identify disaster-vulnerable groups (including fishers, farmers, women, children, and
people with disabilities).
   However, in spite of these initiatives, fishers and farmers are left out in the context
of actual disaster assistance/support. The “environmental” policies in DRRM-CCA
plans focused on activities relating to business and other economic enterprises, with
no mention of how disaster-vulnerable groups benefit from these initiatives. For
instance, Santa Barbara has the Ecological Solid Waste Management Program called
“No Segregation, No Collection Policy” that requires, for example, piggery owners to
have septic tanks. Meanwhile in Oton, plans focus on (liquid/solid) waste segregation
and disposal and on economic enterprises and zoning regulations. These examples
show the inadequacy of specific plans for vulnerable groups, which may include the
creation of social enterprises that diversify livelihood options for farmers/fishers and
strengthen their financial and social capitals. Moreover, plans should also embrace
gender mainstreaming of activities and social inclusion approaches that strengthen
community disaster resilience (Chakrabarti and Enarson, 2009).

Disaster spending
The primary aim of national and local disaster legislation relating to response is for
government to return “normalcy” to communities in the shortest possible time. The
success of disaster policy therefore, requires local government officials to understand
how much should be spent in order to accurately allocate budget for such events.
   Disaster budgets are sourced in many ways: (1) General Appropriations Act (GAA)
through existing budgets of the national line and government agencies; (2) National
Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (NDRRMF); (3) Local Disaster
Risk Reduction and Management Fund (LDRRMF); (4) Priority Development
Assistance Fund (PDAF); (5) donor funds; (6) adaptation and risk financing; and
(7) Disaster Management Assistance Fund (DMAF). Resources are also available from
the following: (1) community-based good practices for replication and scaling up;
(2) indigenous practices on DRRM; (3) public-private-partnerships; and (4) DRR and
CCA networks of key stakeholders. As mandated in Section 21 of RA 10121 of 2010,
the Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (LDRRMF) should be at
least five percent of the estimated revenue from regular sources. This fund will support
disaster risk reduction and management activities.

                This study found that disaster preventive and preparedness activities consume the
             bulk of LDRRM funding. In Santa Barbara, approximately PHP 7 M was allocated in
             2013 for the improvement of structural facilities (e.g. construction and maintenance of
             roads, evacuation centres, drainage, and waterways); PHP 500 000 for climate-resistant
             crops or seeds for farmers; and PHP 100 000 for organic farming. In the same year,
             the local government of Oton spent an estimated PHP 3 M on seminars/trainings of
             rescue team members/volunteers and procurement and installation of early warning
             devices. No specific funds were allocated to other vulnerable groups (e.g. fishers) in
             either municipality.
                Annual disaster spending of municipalities was assessed and classified according to
             three ratings (Table 1). Findings indicate that Santa Barbara incurred a “high” rating
             (PHP 604) whereas Oton incurred a “low” rating (PHP 189).
                Interestingly, both towns have strong legislative ratings; however, each town
             incurred different levels of flood damages and disaster spending. In the case of Santa
             Barbara, the municipality experienced a high level of flood damage despite high
             expenditure on disaster mitigation activities and high (strong) legislative support. In
             contrast, the municipality of Oton experienced a moderate level of flood damages with
             lower disaster spending and high legislative support. These results suggest that the
             municipality of Oton may be using its funds more appropriately and perhaps, more
             systematically, compared to the municipality of Santa Barbara. This can be attributed
             to the low disaster spending in Oton, yet households experienced only moderate flood
             impacts. In contrast, Santa Barbara allocated a lower budget to activities that would
             safeguard the socially disadvantaged households.

             Non-government organizations and civil society organizations
             The differences between the two municipalities can be attributed to the influence of
             “third parties” such as NGOs, including civil society organizations. These institutions
             provide assistance at various levels of disaster management (e.g. preparedness,
             rehabilitation) and (potentially) improve social welfare (Luna, 2001; Gaillard and
             Cadag, 2009). Collaboration between the government and NGOs could strengthen
             monitoring and evaluations, avoid programme or activity duplication, and reduce
             corruption in relief works. On the other hand, strong involvement of NGOs in the
             community facilitates advocacy, planning, and capacity building as well as “influencing
             the jurisprudence of disaster prevention.” Moreover, relief and other commitments
             before, during and after disasters should be clear and transparent in order to reduce
             relief dependency (Islam and Walkerden, 2015).
                In Santa Barbara, the Kabayan Action Group — Santa Barbara (KAG-SB) Chapter
             — acts as ancillary manpower in emergency response and peacekeeping. Similarly,
             the local government of Oton collaborates with volunteers through the Oton
             Search and Rescue Team (OSART) that is responsible for emergency response and
             communication between 37 barangays and the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction
             Management (MDRRM) council. It also cooperates with the Bantay-Dagat (Sea
             Patrol), a community-based volunteer organization, during rescue operations. There
             are also smaller NGOs, such as the Panay Centre for Disaster Response Inc., Creative
             Community Foundation, and Process Foundation Panay Inc. that are involved in relief
             efforts during and after disasters.

             CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             The disaster experience of agricultural and fishing towns in Central Philippines may
             be understood in the context of flood damage, disaster legislation support, and disaster
             expenditure. This exploratory and qualitative study showed that floods mostly affected
             poor communities. Poor households tend to live in close proximity to their natural
             resources (e.g. upland or coast) and depend heavily on these resources for livelihood
Co-managing risk: disaster relief in agricultural and fishing communities in Central Philippines   141




income. Poorer households are more impacted as they have inadequate resources and
lack social support. Flooding affects households in low-lying areas, regardless of their
social status. However, strong disaster-related legislation and high disaster spending of
local government unit translate to low flood damages. Although, findings showed that
despite having strong disaster-related legislation and high disaster spending, floods can
still adversely impact households.
    Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (LDRRM) plans were found to be
one-dimensional in both municipalities, despite having “strong” legislative support.
This is evident through their lack of depth and focus on the well-being of vulnerable
groups before, during, and after disasters. In most cases, there is no comprehensive
and holistic disaster planning, with sectoral roles and responsibilities unclear, limited,
and/or absent. Hence, floods affect resource-dependent households in both inland and
coastal areas.
    Moreover, a thorough analysis of the results suggests that plans should include
specific programmes/projects focusing on disaster vulnerable groups (e.g. poor,
women, fishing households). In Oton, “vulnerable groups”, which include fishers,
farmers, senior citizens, and persons with disabilities, were mentioned in LDRRM
plans; however, the disaster agenda and budget allocation were relatively less focused
on fishers and almost non-existent for other groups. Since these groups have unique
needs and challenges, planners should recognize heterogeneity in developing their
LDRRM plans. Local planners and policymakers should also incorporate a local
economic development agenda within LDRRM plans, so that mitigation and other
disaster activities are sustainable and synergistic (Wisner et al., 2004; Benson, 2009).
    Natural disasters are often politicized and as a result, the allocation of funds can be
inequitable and poorly planned. The findings of this study suggest that large disaster
funds do not necessarily produce the intended results, such as reduced flood impacts,
and would be more effective if local governments properly allocated and managed
the funds. These results are further supported by the fact that nearly half of all local
disaster risk reduction and management funds remain unused or poorly allocated in
municipal disaster-related activities.
    The results also underline the importance of NGOs in successful disaster risk
reduction management. NGO involvement appears to mediate flood impacts through
the strengthening of disaster monitoring and/or minimizing corruption (Bankoff and
Hilhorst, 2009). Thus, coordination between stakeholders should be encouraged or
strengthened in order to promote resilient communities, regardless of their different
perspectives on disaster management.
    Further research is needed to investigate and quantify the relationship between
NGOs and their contribution to low flood impacts. This would include: an in-depth
analysis of LDRRM plans of both municipalities and of the key NGOs working in
the area; exploration of actions specific to community-based mitigation for disaster
vulnerable groups; and examination of the features of successful interventions and
implementation for fishers, farmers and other vulnerable groups (such as the disabled).
Information on their (private/community) mitigation activities and their experiences
with NGOs and other institutions may be particularly useful.
    Flooding as an issue is not divisive and should be treated as a common problem
between stakeholders. Thus, holistic, well-coordinated, and updated disaster legislation
should be developed in order to effectively minimize flood impacts. This paper
presents preliminary evidence of some discrepancies between local disaster spending
and distribution of funds but to better understand disaster spending, annual budget
allocations and line item categories need to be studied in detail. This includes studies
relating to local budget allocations, especially in areas with weak and non-standardized
financial management systems.

                Given these findings, new policies should focus on site-specific, market-driven,
             and collaborative disaster risk reduction management plans for Oton and Santa
             Barbara. A comprehensive understanding of the nature of flood damages, legislative
             support, disaster spending, and NGO collaboration can support vulnerable groups
             and ultimately help in the overall success of local disaster risk reduction management
             in municipalities.

Embracing the value chain
framework for post-disaster
livelihood interventions: the
milkfish industry in an area in
Leyte, Philippines affected by
Haiyan typhoon

ABSTRACT
Typhoon Haiyan destroyed fish-pens and cages in Barangay Santa Cruz in the
municipality of Tanauan, Leyte province, in the Republic of the Philippines in 2013.
Where there was once a highly productive milkfish industry, fishers and households
had to struggle to survive through the economic shocks and dislocation brought
by the sudden-onset disaster. The impacts on women fishers extended beyond the
problems of milkfish production and sales. At home, it was the women who had
to meet the challenges of cash shortages and feeding the family when income from
fishing ceased. The economic opportunity for rehabilitating milkfish production was
pursued with the assistance of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
and government agencies, such as the Department of Trade and Industry and the
Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources. The rehabilitation attempted to build
better structures and employed a “value chain” framework to guide the design of
post-disaster interventions. This paper reviews the processes and gains derived from
the improved and upgraded milkfish value chain to rehabilitate and build resilience
of coastal communities to extreme weather events. It briefly describes the industry
and the opportunities and constraints faced by the four major value chain players:
(1) input suppliers of fingerlings, fries, feeds, and equipment; (2) milkfish producers
who grow, harvest and sell fresh milkfish; (3) processors of soft-bone milkfish/bangus;
and (4) traders, shops and other retail outlets. A major concern of input suppliers
was the high cost of transporting fingerlings from other parts of the country and the
increased mortality rates when the fingerlings are not locally sourced. Feed was also
expensive. The presence of technical and financial support from both government and
non-government agencies was crucial during the transition and establishment of the
business. The fishpen operators were ideal partners for the initiative since they showed
interest in the livelihood by attending meetings, cooperating within the organization,
and participating in planning sessions. The constraints, on the other hand, were the low
survival rates of fries, the oversupply of milkfish from areas not affected by Haiyan,
and weather conditions, particularly the high incidence of typhoons that continue to
impact on operations. Foreseen problems include accessing loans for larger operations
and/or how to expand the enterprise when JICA and other disaster relief support end
and is withdrawn from Barangay Santa Cruz.

             INTRODUCTION
             Much has been said about the damage caused by super-typhoon Haiyan when it made
             landfall on 8 November 2013 in the central Philippines, particularly in the Eastern
             Visayas region where the municipality of Tanauan is located. With wind speeds of
             more than 300 km/hour and storm surges of over 4 m, Haiyan brought unprecedented
             damage that affected 16 million people, displaced 4.1 million people, destroyed
             1.1 million houses, and caused more than 6 300 deaths (USAID, 2014).
                The coastal fishing sector was worst affected, with 86 percent (or 15 913) of fishers
             who were registered under the Municipal Fisheries Registration System (NEDA, 2014)
             in Leyte province being adversely affected by Haiyan. Fishing boats and equipment
             were either lost or damaged beyond repair, and new capital was needed to re-start
             fishing activities. Women involved in the milkfish industry were affected, specifically
             in relation to loss of income from selling fish and from other post-harvest activities.
                This paper examines the experiences of the women milkfish processors, one of
             the most vulnerable groups affected, in the small village of Barangay Santa Cruz, and
             how they were able to rebuild their livelihoods with the assistance of government and
             other organizations, such as JICA. The paper describes the upgrading of the milkfish
             (bangus) sector, specifically the soft-bone bangus industry, with the use of the value
             chain (VC) approach, as initiated by the regional office of the Department of Trade
             and Industry (DTI).

             METHODS
             The data utilized is from a number of participatory community initiatives, such as the
             Milkfish Industry Cluster Value Chain Upgrading workshop conducted in June 2015
             by JICA and the DTI, the Yolanda Knowledge Sharing Forums (Livelihood Cluster
             Session) spearheaded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held in October 2015,
             and the Study on the Promotion and Marketing of High Value Aquaculture Products
             initiated by USAID from June to July 2015. The data were supplemented by key
             informant interviews with officers and members of the Santa Cruz Women Fisherfolk
             Association in order to document the perspectives of female fish processors.

             Pre-Haiyan scenario
             The Eastern Visayas region had been experiencing worsening poverty even before
             Haiyan, with poverty rates increasing from 41.5 percent to 45.2 percent from 2006
             to 2012 (Oxfam, 2014). Poverty incidence among women was similarly rising from
             33.7 percent to 37.4 percent for the same period. Fishing communities registered a
             poverty rate of 29 percent in 2006, with a significant increase to 45.7 percent in 2009
             (Oxfam, 2014). Similarly, the 2011 Annual Poverty Indicator Survey showed that
             among poor families, one in four (or 24.7 percent) suffered hunger, the highest hunger
             incidence among the country’s sixteen geographic regions (PSA, 2013).

             Direct impacts of Haiyan on fisheries
             The destruction caused by Haiyan worsened the socio-economic situation of
             households already under pressure. Poverty rates increased to 55 percent in 2014,
             making the region the poorest in the country (Gabieta, 2015). Fishery production
             dropped by 14 percent, from 161 581 tonnes harvest in 2013 to 137 518 tonnes a year
             after Haiyan. It may be noted, however, that during the previous five years, fishery
             production was already on a consistent downtrend (BFAR, 2015). More than 500 fish
             cages were destroyed by Haiyan, resulting in a drop in aquaculture production from
             34 501 tonnes in 2013 to 30 791 tonnes in 2014. Commercial and municipal fishery
             production dropped by 28 percent and 10 percent, respectively (BFAR, 2015).

POST-HAIYAN RECOVERY ROADMAP
Less than two weeks after Haiyan’s landfall, the National Economic and Development
Authority (NEDA) crafted the Reconstruction Assistance on Yolanda (RAY) — Build
Back Better, to serve as a basis for government interventions. This was followed
in October 2014 by a more detailed plan and roadmap called the Comprehensive
Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan (CRRP) that was signed by the Philippine president.
It consisted of eight volumes that outlined specific programmes, projects and activities
with a total funding requirement for its implementation of PHP 167.86 billion
(USD 4 billion). The budget breakdown was: social services (15.7 percent), livelihoods
(18.2 percent), infrastructure (20.9 percent), and resettlement (45.1 percent). Specific
to the fishing sector, the CRRP included the provision and repair of fishing boats
(bancas), and a total of 30 186 bancas and 13 909 marine engines were consequently
reportedly distributed (NEDA, 2014).
    For the province of Leyte (excluding Tacloban City), an estimated livelihood
investment requirement of PHP 14.57 million (USD 290 000) was determined — the
highest among all Haiyan-affected areas — which reflected the fact that the area was the
worst-affected by Haiyan. The amount for Leyte province totalled PHP 39.569 million
(USD 780 000) once the investment requirements for resettlement, social services, and
infrastructure services were included (NEDA, 2014).

Post-disaster needs assessment
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) identified several programmes
for the recovery and reconstruction phase of the fisheries sector in a needs assessment
conducted in 2015 (BFAR, 2015). These included the following: rehabilitate fish
sanctuaries and fish cage operations in mariculture areas, reinstate environment-
friendly mud crab culture livelihoods, and provide basic start-up materials and
structures for milkfish, tilapia, oyster and seaweed farming.
    Moreover, BFAR supported the repair of boats and provided new ones through its
AHON (Rise) project, a collaborative effort between national and local governments,
NGOs, and the private sector. Two years after Haiyan, BFAR had distributed materials
for the repair of fishing boats to 21 420 fishing families. It has also distributed 1 087
fibreglass boats (Bangkang Pinoy) with 5.5 HP engines to Leyte province (NEDA, 2016).
    Other support and assistance to the municipal fisheries sector included fishing gear
distribution and the provision of marine fish cages. Registered fishers and fisheries
associations were provided with fishing boats and engines, post-harvest equipment
such as chest freezers and fish dryers, capacity building and other technical, product
development and marketing assistance, and credit and insurance facilitation for the
fisheries sector (NEDA, 2014).

Assistance to Barangay Santa Cruz fishing households
Barangay Santa Cruz was provided with basic start-up materials and structure for
milkfish culture in cages, including fingerlings for fish cage operations as well as the
rehabilitation of community-based multispecies hatcheries and stock enhancement
activities.
   In collaboration with the local government unit of Tanauan, donors such as
JICA provided technical and financial assistance to Barangay Santa Cruz. JICA also
partnered with BFAR in the implementation of quick impact projects from 2015 to
2016 to assist recovery and rehabilitation in Barangay Santa Cruz, including installation
of approximately 50 fish pens in the village. The short-term goal was to help restore
economic activities and raise the income of households, and the long-term goal was to
export milkfish as a specialty product of Tanauan to Japan.
   The project is a joint undertaking of the Santa Cruz Fishpen Operators Association,
and Santa Cruz Women’s Fisherfolk Association with the assistance of BFAR, Leyte
148 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             Provincial government, Tanauan municipal government, and Higashi-Matsushima
             City of Miyagi Prefecture of Japan.

             WOMEN FISHERS REBUILDING LIVELIHOODS
             In Barangay Santa Cruz there are two industry associations — the Santa Cruz Fishpen
             Operators Association, which has only men as members, and the Women’s Fisherfolk
             Association. The former raises and produces milkfish, whereas the latter processes the
             milkfish into soft-bone bangus and brings the product to the market. The two associations
             are dependent on each other, with the Santa Cruz Fishpen Operators Association
             providing the input product for the Women’s Fisherfolk Association’s enterprise.
                 Soft-bone bangus is an original recipe of the women in Santa Cruz. The product is
             prepared in a pressure cooker, hence the bones become very soft. The women claim
             that they have a secret recipe that combines ingredients mixed into the bangus to make
             it a palatable product. The soft-bone bangus is packed in air-tight and vacuum-sealed
             bags, labelled and then sold in the market and at selected retail outlets.
                 The President of the Women’s Fisherfolk Association represents the group in
             sectoral meetings that are called by government agencies such as the BFAR and DTI.
             She also does the marketing to retail stores, aiming to sell a regular volume of processed
             soft-bone bangus. At the village level, she ensures that any new information she learns
             is shared with other members of the association.

             Start-up scenario
             Five months after Haiyan (i.e., July 2014, the Santa Cruz Fisherfolk Association
             officially started its business of processing soft-bone bangus. It produced 700 kg per
             year, processing two to three boxes of fresh bangus per week with 30 kg per box.
             All inputs were sourced from outside Tanauan and the market was limited to the
             municipality, which bought 85 percent of the soft-bone bangus produced. Members of
             the Women’s Fisherfolk Association received a ten peso (USD 0.21) incentive for every
             pack of processed milkfish sold. Women who participated in processing were provided
             free meals and drinks as labour compensation during the period the business was not
             making money. Others were volunteers in the temporary processing facility. Dividends
             were distributed at the end of the year.
                The equipment for the start-up was provided by JICA and women initially started
             working with two pressure cookers of 40 litres capacity each, a refrigerator and a
             vacuum sealer. The business initially did not have a License to Operate from the Food
             and Drug Administration, but the required papers were being prepared. The start-up
             business commenced even before women’s village houses were fixed and the rescue and
             relief phase of the humanitarian work was still ongoing.

             Transition state
             In December 2015 (18 months after Haiyan), the JICA-assisted livelihood programme
             for the survivors of Haiyan entered its transition phase. The processing facility was
             improved, and the equipment doubled (four pressure cookers, two refrigerators,
             two vacuum sealers, and two deep freezers), and production increased by about
             600 percent. The Women’s Fisherfolk Association no longer got their milkfish supply
             from outside Tanauan but from the Santa Cruz Fishpen Operators Association, which
             was simultaneously assisted by JICA and the government to recommence their fishpen
             operations. The latter sold fresh milkfish at PHP 110.00 (USD 2.35) per kg.
                The softbone bangus product was sold for cash or credit, as well as on consignment
             every 15 days to three contracted outlets in the nearby city. The product, wrapped
             in banana-leaf, was packed in printed vacuum bags with a packet of pineapple-pickle
             sauce, another product of the Women’s Fisherfolk Association. It has a registered
             product name and labelling and the Association has commenced the application for
Embracing the value chain framework for post-disaster livelihood interventions: the milkfish industry   149




trademark and patent, together with the processing of a License to Operate with the
assistance of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
   With the increase in sales, the Women’s Fisherfolk Association was able to pay
management incentives to three of their officers, and processing incentives to seven
women-processors each day. At the end of 2016, dividends taken from a portion of the
net profits were shared to all the Association members.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The Women Fisherfolk Association has been integral in improving the livelihood
options and income of women in Barangay Santa Cruz after Typhoon Haiyan as well
as recommencing the milkfish pen operations of the Santa Cruz Fishpen Operators
Association. The future target is to process soft-bone bangus five days a week with an
input of 30 kg of milkfish per day. The Santa Cruz Fishpen Operators Association will
be invited to become co-investors in the processing business, an important arrangement
to ensure a regular supply of fresh milkfish for the processors.
    Part of the business plan is for cash, credit and consignment sales to continue with
the aim of expanding into a larger market, including seeking more contracted outlets
and possible export to a partner in Japan once production volumes are large enough.
It is envisioned that the management and processing incentives can be increased to
standard market rates, and to benefit more female workers. Moreover, the Association
is aiming for at least 50 percent of the net annual profit to be available for distribution
as dividends. Finally, the License to Operate, the Certificate of Product Registration
from the Food and Drug Administration, and the trademark and patent for soft-bone
bangus will be finalized.

UPGRADING THE MILKFISH INDUSTRY CLUSTER VALUE CHAIN
The Women’s Fisherfolk Association believes that the reason for the quick transition of
their small-scale soft-bone bangus business from “nothing” to “something profitable”
may be attributed to three factors: (1) the use of the value chain approach in developing
and promoting the milkfish industry cluster; (2) the support and collaboration of JICA
with the local government unit, government agencies, and other value chain actors/
players within the umbrella programme of recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation
after Haiyan; and (3) the women’s willingness to build the business by starting with
nominal pay or as volunteers.
   The value chain approach has shown the stakeholders the importance of bringing
all the actors together for consultation, validation, planning, and establishing the
business enterprise. Workshops were conducted to determine the status of the milkfish
industry, particularly soft-bone bangus and the strengths and weaknesses of the value
chain, as well as to develop a plan of action and interventions.
   Although the approach described here seems simple, it requires significant
coordination, cooperation, and communication across all sectors. That is, from the
supplier of inputs, to the fish farmers, milkfish growers, soft-bone bangus processors,
and sellers, traders and retailers. The sequence of related business activities (known
as VC functions) were identified together with the corresponding set of enterprises
(known as VC operators/actors) to link and coordinate each in order to produce soft-
bone bangus (Figure 1). The value chain players realized the synergies and gains from
coordinating with each other and strengthening their value chain.

The VC players/operators
All of the 62 fishpens in Barangay Santa Cruz were lost or damaged by Haiyan. JICA
helped rehabilitate 42 fishpens, with each operator receiving one fishpen of 1 000 m2,
each with 18 000 fingerlings, and production and harvests were scheduled so that
everyone was able to sell their product.

                Other inputs were sourced from various enterprises, some of which were in
             areas not affected by Haiyan. With more production, the fishpen operators needed
             additional buyers of fresh milkfish. The women soft-bone bangus processors were the
             answer. However, the latter were new in the industry and the product was new in the
             market, hence, a lot of marketing effort was needed.

             Opportunities and constraints
             A major concern of input suppliers is the high cost of transporting fingerlings from
             other parts of the country and the higher mortality rates if the fingerlings are not
             locally sourced. Feed is also expensive, making input provision relatively costly. The
             presence of technical and financial support from both government and non-government
             agencies was crucial during the transition and establishment of the business. Sourcing
             more inputs locally, including plans for establishing a hatchery, are key actions to
             secure supply and reduce costs (Figure 2).
                For the production phase of the value chain, support from BFAR, DTI, and DOST
             and JICA was critical in providing start-up capital and the technical assistance for
             fish pen operations to recommence after Haiyan. The fish pen operators were ideal
             partners for the initiative since they showed interest in the livelihood by attending
             meetings, cooperating within the organization, and participating in planning sessions.
             The constraints, however, are the low survival rates of fries, the oversupply of milkfish
             from areas not affected by Haiyan, and weather conditions, particularly the high
             incidence of typhoons that are expected to continue to impact on operations. The
             operators also foresee challenges in accessing loans for larger operations or to expand
             in the future when JICA and other disaster relief support is withdrawn from Barangay
             Santa Cruz.
                Women dominate the processing phase of soft-bone bangus and have developed a
             niche product in the market. The recipe is unique and demand is growing, including
             by restaurants. The women’s processors’ association was given equipment and start-up
             capital with support from government agencies. There are wider community benefits
             in supporting the women processors in that they are able to produce large volumes
             for markets outside the municipality. On the other hand, there are constraints which

include: lack of storage facilities, low level of trust among members in the association
as a result of unclear division of labour and tasking in the processing facility, poor
management and processing incentives given to women processors, and a lack of
entrepreneurial skills. Although the association is able to operate fully at present, there
is concern about its long-term sustainability once JICA exits.
    Next in the value chain is trading. Since the soft-bone bangus is a new product, it
has yet to secure a certificate of product registration and other licenses from relevant
government bodies. There are similar and substitute products in the market, and
limited contract retailers at present. Marketing is limited to the domestic sector and
current marketing channels are insufficient to compete effectively. There is, however,
significant market potential for soft-bone bangus locally and in Japan, facilitated
by JICA, which is willing to import the product from the Philippines in the future.
Soft-bone bangus can be built as a “brand product” for Tanauan since there is no
other municipality in the Philippines that produces the same product. More product
innovation and product concepts may also emerge over time increasing the market
potential of bangus, for example, promoting it as a “gift item” (pasalubong). The long-
term goal is for soft-bone bangus to be associated with Santa Cruz, Tanauan and for it
to become the municipality’s post-Haiyan icon.
    There remains a lot of marketing and product work to fully realize the potential
of softbone bangus, including: better packaging and labelling, more advertising and
promotion, and improvements in the shelf life of the product. There is also a need
to improve product quality (e.g. taste, colour), and upgrade the processing facility
(handling and packaging) to adhere to international standards. At the local level,
the product is marketable and enjoys the curiosity of households who want to taste
something new.

             Value chain upgrading strategies
             An industry vision was defined in a workshop attended by all participants (men and
             women) in the value chain. The industry vision was to provide interventions and
             strategies that will have the widest reach, the biggest impact and are achievable to
             deliver short-term value chain benefits. Each VC function has to be strengthened to
             ensure a sustainable industry. There may be sufficient producers (fish farmers) but if
             marketing is weak, then the former will not maximize economies of scale. Similarly,
             even if marketing is excellent, but the processors are not producing quality soft-bone
             bangus, then the traders will not succeed.
                For the VC function on input provision, the players plan to develop local hatcheries
             for fingerling production in order to supply fish farmers with cheaper inputs and for
             the latter to experience less fingerling/fry mortality. This should be coupled with
             initiatives to improve the skills of the manpower that will operate the hatcheries.
                For the VC function on production, the fishpen operators are looking into strategies
             that will improve access to finance, and human resource development. Activities geared
             towards investment promotion will have to be conducted. Advocacy and lobbying for
             the inclusion of fish pen operations for insurance coverage will be helpful since the
             municipality is geographically prone to typhoons.
                Improved financing schemes to answer the sustainability of soft-bone bangus
             processing in a post-JICA scenario is also important. Initiatives to improve the quality
             of the product must be given priority. Regular production in order to meet larger
             market demands will have to be worked out. Moreover, the entrepreneurial skills of
             the women processors need enhancement.
                The next VC function is marketing. Access to markets through selling missions,
             joining product fares, and obtaining the requirements of various buyers are identified as
             strategies. So, too, are effective promotions, labelling, packaging and market penetration.
             Using social media to improve marketing channels is recommended. A good database
             will have to be maintained for the purposes of planning, coordination, and monitoring.

             THE CRUCIAL ROLES OF THE VALUE CHAIN ENABLERS
             The value chain enablers both at the meso-level (i.e., private partners and organizations/
             associations) and at the macro-level (i.e., government agencies and local government
             units) have significant roles to play in areas such as, but not limited to: (a) human
             resource development through coaching, values orientation, and the conduct of
             organizational and entrepreneurial training events; (b) information dissemination
             through networking using market information databases; (c) conduct of updated
             market research on soft-bone bangus; (d) wider insurance coverage to fishers’
             enterprises in the value chain; (e) policy creation and enforcement through ordinances
             and other regulatory requirements; (f) access to finance, particularly loans without
             collateral; and (g) investment promotion, and market matching.
                The BFAR is the lead agency supporting the women processors of soft-bone
             bangus. It released a set of policies and incentives relevant to the industry after Haiyan.
             Examples include the provision of inputs through the construction of fish cages and
             fish traps for fish culture, and provision of the corresponding initial batch of milkfish
             fingerlings. Quarterly monitoring on fish production is important as a basis in the
             determination of the carrying capacity of the area. Likewise, post-harvest facilities
             need to be provided to fisherfolk associations who must have wider access to financial
             assistance, marketing/handling, and other forms of services. For the processors, they
             have to embrace business/entrepreneurial practices that promote food safety and the
             global competitiveness of the products.
                These policies and incentives are geared towards ensuring good quality fishery
             products. The sustainability of the fishery programmes — from the input provision to
             the trading/selling of processed milkfish — is built into the mechanism of the creation
Embracing the value chain framework for post-disaster livelihood interventions: the milkfish industry   153




of the Executive Management Council, which is chaired by the local chief executive,
particularly, the municipal/city mayor.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
A disaster-resilient milkfish industry cluster is a target to achieve. This will have to be
worked out by all the operators and enablers of the value chain, from input provision
to production, to processing, and to marketing.
   From the perspective of the women processors of soft-bone bangus, they need
to be assured of continuous production and sale of the product. As defined by the
value chain framework, this means that the fish pen operators must have continuous
production which will only happen if they have a continuous supply of inputs from the
various providers of fingerling, feeds and other inputs. Having submersible cages that
can withstand typhoons and extreme events is also a good practice (introduced after
Hiayan) that should be continued.
   Moreover, continuous production must be complemented with the presence of
traders who will increasingly gain larger and wider markets for soft-bone bangus,
which will be demanded by retailers, restaurants, shops/malls, and households either
as ready-to-eat food, or gift/tokens (pasalubong), or as for resale.
   In order to strengthen the value chain for the industry cluster, the VC governance
needs improvement. Most of the time, players act individually. This will not lead to
economies of scale or the sustainability of the industry. VC governance necessitates the
identification of lead enterprises/lead actors who will ensure that industry standards
are followed, and industry practices are continually being upgraded. This means
that if the traders’ group want quality soft-bone bangus, then they should reject the
processors’ output which is considered poor quality, then the processors will reject the
fish farmers’ output which is of poor quality, and the fish farmers will make sure they
only get the best from the input suppliers. In contrast, if the trader receives everything
that the processors give them regardless of quality, then there will be a domino effect
of poor quality input coming from backward linkages and poor quality outputs going
to forward linkages.
   Value chain governance needs to be geared towards value chain resilience to extreme
events and climate change. Enabling mechanisms must be institutionalized, such as the
inclusion of the industry roadmap in the municipality’s Annual Investment Plan and
the Comprehensive Development Plan.
   Finally, knowing how success will be measured in quantifiable terms must be
clear to everyone involved. For a value chain to be upgraded and strengthened, good
gender-responsive value chain governance and the use of gender-sensitive value chain
monitoring tools are necessary. For post-disaster interventions, the case of the Santa
Cruz soft-bone bangus small-scale industry has shown that this livelihood will be
meaningful if all the value chain functions are given equal importance and attention by
responders to disasters.

INTRODUCTION
Smallholder aquaculture is sustainable indefinitely in the face of climate change only,
we propose, if smallholders can develop genetic strains adapted to their — increasingly
unpredictable — local environments. We further suggest that this is more likely to happen
if aquaculture smallholders participate in genetic exchange networks, variously called
“community-based breeding programs” (CBBP) (Mueller et al., 2015), “participatory
plant breeding” (Ceccarelli et al., 2010) or “on-farm dynamic management” (Thomas
et al., 2015), that allow concurrent rapid adaptation to local climate change threats
and opportunities in a range of environments. CBBP enable the dynamic change
that characterizes terrestrial crop “landrace” systems — open, decentralized genetic
systems that are constantly evolving (Bellon et al., 2015; Hellin et al., 2014; Loeuille
et al., 2013; Poudel and Sthapit, 2015; Sthapit, Padulosi and Mal, 2010; Thomas et al.,
2015) — while avoiding inbreeding and genetic erosion (Doyle, 2016). Developing
aquaculture CBBP networks will have challenges; however the basic social frameworks
for CBBP already exist in many places (Bellon et al., 2015; Frison, 2016; Pautasso et al.,
2013; Szuster, 2006). Technical help from local and regional government organizations
and institutions, as well as non-government organizations, will be required (Mueller
et al., 2015; Sthapit, Padulosi and Mal, 2010). A recent review and analysis of CBBP in
Latin America, Africa and Asia highlights this high dependence of CBBP on external
organizational, technical and financial support (Hellin et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015).

HOW SUCCESSFUL SMALLHOLDER GENETIC ADAPTATION WORKS
Since domestication of animals began more than 15 000 years ago, people have adapted
to new environments by genetically modifying the animals they depend upon. At
present, with increasing environmental variability, having a diversity of combinations
of genes and traits that are constantly selected in response to changing conditions and
growing knowledge should allow aquaculture to adapt better to climate change (Doyle,
2014), as is the case in other commodities.
   Networked breeders and farmers exert on-farm selection pressures that change
from location to location and over time in the face of climate change stressors and
emerging pathogens (Hellin et al., 2014; Loeuille et al., 2013). The key aspect of
CPPB is that, whereas local strains are continuously developed for cultivation, the
networked, global meta-population continues to evolve indefinitely as a sustainable
source of continuously better-adapted genetic material for industrial aquaculture as
156 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             well as smallholders (Ceccarelli et al., 2010). A networking approach allows efforts to
             be directed at enhancing diverse local adaptive capacities as a complement to a small
             number of worldwide (generally industrial) adaptations (Hellin et al., 2014).
                 Coping with an increasing rate of climate change in smallholder aquaculture may,
             as in terrestrial plant and animal production, require the development of new social
             networks of a modern type (Bellon et al., 2015; Frison, 2016; Pautasso et al., 2013).
             It is unlikely that this can be solely a bottom-up process, as evidenced for example in
             Thailand (Szuster, 2006). According to Sthapit, Padulosi and Mal (2010):
                 [farmers’] ability to cope with impacts of climate change will be strengthened if the
             research and development institutions can [strengthen] social seed networks and policy
             supports that promote farmer-to-farmer [germplasm] exchange systems.
                 At least 59 different types of interventions for supporting on-farm conservation
             have been identified (Bellon and Vanetten, 2014). Research and development agencies
             will play a crucial role in technical and organizational aspects of guiding germplasm
             exchanges within aquaculture networks that are adapting to climate change (Bellon and
             Vanetten, 2014; Carroll et al., 2014, Hellin et al., 2014; Mueller et al., 2015; Pautasso
             et al., 2013; Sthapit, Padulosi and Mal, 2010). Furthermore, modern, high-tech crop
             varieties are often grown together with local landraces in agricultural communities
             experiencing a range of climates (Bellon et al., 2015, Pautasso et al., 2013).
                 The high fecundity of shrimp can lead to rapid inbreeding and enhanced
             susceptibility to disease (Bellon et al. 2015; Doyle, 2016), as well as a reduced
             capacity to evolve, which results from loss of genetic diversity in small broodstocks.
             Unfortunately, although genetic exchange is widespread among smallhold aquaculture
             farmers, it is largely undocumented and not informed by genetics (Szuster, 2006). As
             noted by Poudel, Sthapit and Shrethsa (2015):
                    Strengthening the collective actions of [CBBP] communities in variety access, selection
                    and seed production activities will ensure the flow of quality seeds in the community.
                    This process will strengthen farmer’s capacity to cope with climate change in traditional
                    production systems.
                 Adding germplasm exchange functions to existing or new aquaculture networks,
             and to supporting organizations and institutions, will present both technical and social
             challenges, as described for other sectors. The most obvious challenge is to implement
             procedures for exchanging germplasm that do not also cause the spread of disease.
             Existing national and international disease-control policies (essentially, broodstock
             isolation) inhibit the formation of CBBP germplasm exchange networks that would
             constitute an evolutionary basis for sustainable, diverse, long-term, adaptive resistance
             to pathogens (Doyle, 2014). The heart of the technical/policy dilemma is a feedback
             system (Doyle, 2014) within which, while pathogens are evolving in response to climate
             change, broodstock isolation reduces the genetic and evolutionary capacity to resist
             new and increasing disease threats. The feedback loop is completed when a decrease in
             aquaculture production caused by disease results, in accordance with isolation policies,
             with increased genetic erosion and inbreeding (Doyle, 2014 and 2016).

             CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             The uncertainty surrounding the specific impacts of climate-change is reflected in
             growing interest in adaptive capacity as an alternative focus of policy efforts, rather
             than specific adaptations, e.g. adaptations to controlled industrial environments that
             are isolated from environmental and pathogenic stressors associated with climate
             change (Hellin et al., 2014; Sthapit , Padulosi and Mal, 2010). The fact that CBBP
             systems can be economically self-sustaining, while remaining dependent on technical
             and other support from advanced technical institutions and organizations, in relevant
             cultural milieus and levels of technological maturity is demonstrated by the success of
             terrestrial crop and livestock farmer associations in the Republic of India, the Kingdom
How smallholder aquaculture communities can survive and prosper by genetically adapting their broodstock   157




of Thailand, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Republic of France, the Americas and
elsewhere.
    Technical developments that facilitate CBBP networking will also enable national
and multinational agencies to monitor and manage aquaculture networks as large
meta-populations, which, collectively, preserve the genetic diversity of domesticated
stocks indefinitely as a global, common genetic resource. The need for an aquaculture
system redesign that both creatively uses and conserves or increases genetic diversity
is especially acute in the Asia-Pacific region and other regions where smallholders are
currently responsible for an estimated 70 percent of total shrimp production (Doyle,
2016). Although we emphasize that successful CBBP need to receive help from
institutions and extension staff (Mueller et al., 2015), the power in decision-making will
remain with farmers as their local climates change. Smallholder farmers will have social
ownership of the CPPB evolutionary and germplasm exchange programmes (Mueller
et al., 2015).

SUMMARY OF ESSENTIAL STEPS
  1. recognize the value of community-level, science-driven adaptation of smallholder
     aquaculture to deal with the local effects of climate change;
  2. organize the necessary administrative and policy support for modern germplasm
     exchange networks; and
  3. develop new technical understanding and procedures for implementing local
     broodstock selection and safe, biosecure regional and global germplasm exchange.

INTRODUCTION
Viewing fisheries and aquaculture through a food security lens ensures that the
sector meets food, nutrition and livelihood needs. The sector generates small-scale
livelihoods, employment, wealth, national and international trade, entrepreneurship
and contributes to farming of other food production systems. Fishing communities
also play an important role in safeguarding local cultures, indigenous technical
knowledge and maintaining social and cultural identity and values. Fish is a source
of food across classes and geographic regions including rural and urban, poor, middle
class and upper class with many poor people being highly dependent on fish for food
and income. Fisheries provide livelihoods for over 200 million people and 90 percent of
these people are in developing countries. They also provide a safety net income source
for those experiencing temporary or seasonal hunger or unemployment. However,
people who depend on fisheries and aquaculture for their livelihoods are increasingly
vulnerable to natural and human hazards, which are occurring more frequently and
projected to increase in intensity under climate change, affecting developing countries
disproportionately.
   In this context, there is a need for workshops to build stakeholders’ capacity to
plan for and respond to emergencies in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. The aim of
these workshops should be to raise awareness of stakeholders about the vulnerability
of the sector, the current frameworks for response, the need to be better prepared, and
to enhance the quality and accountability of stakeholders in preparedness and response
to emergencies affecting the fisheries and aquaculture sector.
   This paper draws on best practices and experiences in responding to natural hazards
that have affected communities working in fisheries and aquaculture, and overviews
the workshops conducted to build capacity in stakeholders to integrate fisheries and
aquaculture in emergency response and preparedness based on existing capacities and
expected needs as per the guidelines of FAO (Brown and Poulain, 2013; Cattermoul
et al., 2014).

METHODS
Workshops were designed to build upon Fisheries and Aquaculture Emergency
Response Guidance by Cattermoul et al., (2014) and Guidelines for the Fisheries and
160 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             Aquaculture Sector on Damage and Needs Assessments in Emergencies by Brown and
             Poulain (2013) published by FAO. These documents are guidelines available to support
             those responding to an emergency involving the fisheries and aquaculture sector, and
             are designed to improve the quality and accountability of preparedness and response
             to emergencies affecting the fishery and aquaculture sector.
                With this background, workshops were conducted in the states of Maharashtra,
             West Bengal (WB) and Assam in the Republic of India. The aim of the first workshop
             was to raise awareness of stakeholders about the vulnerability of the sector, the current
             frameworks for response and the need to be better prepared through appropriate
             training. The aim of the subsequent two workshops was to enhance the quality and
             accountability of stakeholders in preparedness and responding to emergencies affecting
             the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Core content areas that were addressed in these
             workshops were:
                • importance of the fisheries and aquaculture sector;
                • disasters affecting the sector;
                • role of government and non-government organizations (NGOs) involved in
                   emergency response;
                • context of humanitarian action;
                • mechanisms for disaster response; and
                • standards underpinning humanitarian actions and fisheries and aquaculture
                   interventions so as to improve participants’ understanding and their capacity to
                   respond to emergencies and plan for fisheries and aquaculture.
                Assessing loss and damage in fisheries is a key requirement in many disaster
             situations so the expected outputs of the workshops were to help build the necessary
             capacity to improve the quality of the assessments undertaken.
                A total of 87 participants (Workshop I: 30, Workshop II: 24 and Workshop III: 33)
             attended these workshops. A questionnaire with simple Yes/No answer choices was
             administered to 30 participants (before and after the workshops) with the objective of
             testing participants’ knowledge on issues related to core content areas of the workshops.
             Five issues selected from the contents of the workshop were: (1) the importance of
             the fisheries and aquaculture sector; (2) disasters affecting the sector; (3) standards
             underpinning humanitarian actions; (4) fisheries and aquaculture interventions to
             assess loss and damage in disaster situations; and (5) how to improve the quality of the
             assessments which are undertaken. Before and after workshop scores were analysed to
             determine if there was improvement in understanding for these categories after each
             workshop.

             SUMMARY RESULTS
             The first workshop conducted in Mumbai on 18 December 2015 was attended by
             30 diverse stakeholders. There was representation from central government, from
             state government, from district level, from NGOs, and from fishery cooperatives,
             academicians, researchers and youth.
                The second workshop was organized from 25 to 27 February 2016 in the Sundarbans
             region, at ICAR-Central Institute of Brackish Water Aquaculture (CIBA), Kakdwip,
             WB. The 24 workshop participants were from nine organizations representing five
             NGOs. Participants were also from a few universities and from the state government.
                The third workshop was organized at the Fisheries Research Centre, Assam
             Agriculture University, Jorhat from 10 to 12 March 2016. The third workshop was
             attended by 33 participants representing NGOs, a local fisheries college, ICAR-
             Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI); a number of progressive fish
             farmers, and staff from the department of fisheries in two areas.
                In the northeast region, recurrent flooding causes vast damage to both capture and
             culture fishery resources almost every year, and often make rural people homeless.

Another impending threat to fishery resources is the scarcity of water. Taking these
issues into consideration, locale-specific case studies were developed for the workshop.
   It was found that for “importance of fisheries and aquaculture sector” and “disasters
affecting the sector”, not much improvement in the participants’ scores was obtained.
Participants reported that they were aware of the sector’s importance to the livelihoods
of people and also the general types of natural disasters that affect the sector. However,
with reference to “standards underpinning humanitarian actions”, “fisheries and
aquaculture interventions assessing loss and damage in disaster situations” and
“improving the quality of the assessments undertaken”, improvement in the scores was
obtained. These results plus feedback from participants, demonstrate that workshops
were able to build some necessary capacity of stakeholders in enhancing the quality and
accountability of stakeholders in preparedness and response to emergencies affecting
fisheries and aquaculture sector.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Reflecting on the experience of the three-day fisheries and emergencies course, it was
observed that the participatory approach of the training and learning through case
studies and group exercises was successful in building knowledge. Suggestions by
participants about the content and process to improve the training experience included
the addition of case studies for specific types of natural disasters, and translation of
reading materials into local languages.
   To take this forward, this knowledge and capacity needs to be incorporated into
academic curricula of fisheries courses to teach best-practices to the next generation
who will be at the forefront of assisting vulnerable communities affected by disasters
in their countries and regions. Youth in turn can strengthen the support provided to
vulnerable fishing and aquaculture communities as they build resilience to natural
disasters. It is expected that appropriately informed and trained people can undertake
better needs assessments and planned responses, and can also advocate for the
importance and needs of the sector leading to improved fisheries management.

Introduction
Climate change is affecting the livelihoods of fishers in the Sundarbans, a unique
Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site. Mangroves of the Sundarbans represent rich
and unique ecosystems that are distributed over two countries — the Republic of India
and the Republic of Bangladesh. The Indian Sundarbans occupies 4 267 km2 of the total
area of 14 300 km2 that encompasses 19 adjacent blocks in West Bengal (Department
of Sundarban Affairs, 2016). The ecosystems of the Sundarbans are a nursery ground
for nearly 90 percent of aquatic species on the east coast, and coastal fisheries in eastern
India depend upon the Sundarbans (Chandra and Sagar, 2003). The area is home to more
than 4 million people and consists of 104 islands, with 54 inhabited (Department of
Sundarban Affairs, 2016; Government of India, 2011). Nath (2016) reported that climate
change has resulted in the submergence of Supari Bhanga and Lohachara islands of the
Sundarbans, and the primary concern is future sea-level rise that is expected to further
increase island submergence (Seggel and De Young, 2016). Homeless inhabitants of these
islands have migrated to Sagar Island as environmental refugees. Being internationally
recognized, the Sundarbans is a focal point for many non-government organization
(NGO) projects. Different funding agencies have supported livelihood interventions in
the Sundarbans, including for fisheries affected by climate change.
    The Department of Fisheries, Department of Sundarban Affairs, Government of
West Bengal, and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research all work on climate
change and livelihood interventions in the Sundarbans. Although governmental
organizations (GOs) and NGOs are involved in a range of fisheries development
activities, few studies have investigated the role of NGOs in supporting climate change
adaptation. This study addressed this need by analysing the various interventions
and programmes undertaken by NGOs on livelihood development under a changing
climate in the Sundarbans region.

METHODS
The project collected information from officials, key informants of NGOs, using focus
group discussions (FGD) and also from secondary sources such as annual reports
and official records, and identified approximately 111 NGOs working on agri-allied
activities for livelihood development in the study area. Of these, seven NGOs had
been intensively working on fishers’ livelihood and climate change interventions in
164 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             the Sundarbans region. Thus, these seven NGOs were selected for this study (Table 1).
             The officials of these seven NGOs were surveyed using a structured interview
             schedule. They provided information on interventions related to capacity development
             programmes on disaster management in fisheries and aquaculture, techniques of
             climate resilient aquaculture, fishery inputs and supports for mitigating the adverse
             effects of climate change, and aquaculture restoration practices. The parameters were:
             working area (i.e. the blocks they cover); interventions; funding agencies; number of
             beneficiaries from the project; and the training programmes provided. In addition,
             information was collected on the detailed activities for climate change adaptation
             undertaken by each NGO.
                Preliminary studies showed that NGOs are involved in interventions such as

             initiatives for the fishing communities in the Sundarbans. Content analysis was
             performed by using conceptual and relational analysis (Ghosh and Sharma, 2014) to
             study the details of interventions for mitigating climate change issues and funding
             status in a more comprehensive manner. For this, secondary data were collected from
             the offices of NGOs and through FGD for the last three years, i.e. 2012-13 to 2014-
             15, as the World Bank Funded Integrated Coastal Zone Management Programme
             (ICZMP) was operational during this period. Descriptive statistics were applied to
             analyse the information.

             SUMMARY RESULTS
             The present study revealed that among different livelihood interventions available,
             NGOs gave priority to environmental awareness campaigns, environmental awareness
             mapping, biodiversity/climate awareness programmes and observation of special
             environmental days/weeks. These initiatives were mainly funded by the World Bank
             under the ICZMP, and other sponsors included the Ministry of Environment and
             Forests, Government of India, the West Bengal Biodiversity Board, Government of
             West Bengal and the Institute of Environment Studies and Wetland Management, West
             Bengal. Approximately USD 630 000 (INR 42.20 M) was invested in climate change
             issues out of a total expenditure of USD 4.16 million by NGOs in the Sundarbans
             region for the 2014-15 financial year. The primary impacts of climate change in the
             Sundarbans are: sea-level rise; island inundation; increasing salinity in water and soil
             resulting in adverse effect on mangrove forests; changes to fishing patterns; and an
             erratic monsoon which is detrimental to fishing communities. The interventions of
             NGOs on issues of climate changes do not appear to be coordinated or consistent, and
             are presented in Table 2.

             CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             The seven NGOs working in the area of fisheries and climate change in the Sundarbans
             undertake project activities and training programmes related to different capacity

166 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             development programmes on disaster management in fisheries and aquaculture,
             techniques of climate resilient aquaculture, fishery inputs and supports for mitigating
             the adverse effects of climate change and restoring aquaculture practices. However,
             the study has revealed that there is no comprehensive plan of activities or strategy to
             coordinate climate change activities by NGOs. Currently, NGOs focus on working
             areas as needs arise rather than having a strategic plan of action with clear benefits for
             the livelihood of fishers. This is a major gap that needs to be addressed.

             RECOMMENDATIONS
             In general, a greater focus is needed by NGOs in raising awareness in fishing
             communities about how to develop climate resilient fisheries, and to provide adaptation
             solutions, particularly on the remote islands of the Sundarbans. Such activities will
             require better coordination with government and participation of NGOs in relevant
             capacity building programmes at a national level. Other specific recommendations
             include:

             Policy issues
             Details of socio-economic and livelihood profiles of fishers, and needs assessment
             results, should inform a targeted programme of climate change adaptation and policy
             formulation. Such information can also facilitate effective partnerships between
             government — Department of Fisheries, Sundarban Development Board, Indian
             Council of Agricultural Research — private organizations and NGOs. In addition,
             greater awareness and compliance should be encouraged with all stakeholders to follow
             environmental protection laws and regulations.

             Technology and infrastructure development
             NGOs need greater knowledge and capacity in implementing the latest technologies
             for climate change adaptation, such as online management systems, human resource
             development and analytical modules, communication and e-extension technologies to
             reach more beneficiaries.

             Financial
             As NGOs operate under resource limited circumstances (e.g. labour, skills and funds),
             greater effort should focus on obtaining funds from national and international donor
             agencies. Improved financial support should be accorded to ensure record keeping
             and documentation at the end of projects and accountability to ensure project funding
             targets key needs and has been invested responsibly.
                 Reports suggest that climate change is resulting in sea-level rise, disappearing
             islands, increasing salinity in the water and soil resulting in adverse effect on the
             health of mangrove forests, soil, change in fishing patterns, erratic monsoon which is
             detrimental to the fishing communities. This study showed that NGOs gave priority to
             environmental awareness campaigns, environmental awareness mapping, biodiversity/
             climate awareness programmes and observation of special environmental days/weeks.
             There is a need for greater project coordination, and for NGOs to make fishing
             communities more aware of climate resilient fisheries and to provide adaptive solutions
             to climate change for fishing communities.

ABSTRACT
The broad concept of insurance as a risk management tool and a climate change
adaptation strategy in aquaculture and fishery has been widely accepted by governments
and their fisheries sectors. This prompted the trial of schemes designed to insure
a large pool of farmers and fishers on the one hand and to be a viable business for
insurers on the other. Examples from the People’s Republic of China and the Socialist
Republic of Viet Nam illustrate the attempts to achieve these two linked outcomes.
Generally, small-scale and medium-scale farmers’ and fishers’ access to insurance cover
is still limited and there is a need for well-designed insurance products that suit the
circumstances and needs of such farmers and fishers. Innovative insurance programmes
can promote good farm management practices. Public-private partnership models such
as mutual insurance can be feasible in providing insurance services to groups of small
farmers, but government subsidies are needed initially.

with a variety of phenomena: physical (flood, drought, storms, cyclones, abnormal
temperatures, etc.); biological (diseases, pests, harmful algal blooms); chemical
(acidification, salinization of freshwater, oil spills, chemical leaks, contaminated run-
offs); and geological (landslides, mudslides, tsunami). Except for oil spills, chemical
leaks, run-offs and tsunami, and damage to fishing assets from fire on board fishing
vessels, engine failure or running aground, almost all of these hazards are driven by,
associated with, or exacerbated by climatic variability. These have exacerbated market
risks.
   Awareness of the opportunities and benefits offered by insurance as a financial tool
for risk management has been raised among governments and aquaculture industries:
farmers can recover their businesses faster after a disaster; insurance combined
with other tools such as credit can encourage investments in farm improvement,
better management and new technology, which increase the resilience of farmers
to the impacts of climatic and economic disasters; and insurance enables farmers to
participate actively in risk management. As a public investment in a partnership among
government, commercial insurers, farmer groups and value chain actors, it lightens
government’s costly burden of disaster relief, recovery and rehabilitation efforts, all of
which comprise an adaptation strategy.

             METHODS
             Having been accepted by policymakers as a climate change adaptation strategy,
             insurance initiatives moved to the practical issues of: (a) making aquaculture
             insurance a viable and sustainable business; and (b) farmers being able to participate
             continuously in insurance programmes. The national programmes that are described
             below are pilot schemes aimed at achieving these two outcomes. The information is
             derived from a review of the People’s Republic of China’s capture fishery and pilot
             aquaculture insurance programmes (FAO, 2017) and a review of the Socialist Republic
             of Viet Nam’s pilot agriculture insurance programme that covers rice, livestock and
             aquaculture (FAO, 2016). The China review is informed by case reports of mutual,
             commercial, “mutual + commercial” and “cooperative plus commercial” arrangements.
             The Viet Nam review focused on the aquaculture component.

             SUMMARY RESULTS

             Improvement of risk management capabilities
             Awareness raising of insurance for risk management. Fishers and fish farmers used
             to consider insurance only for loss of life, accident injury and catastrophe, not as a
             risk management measure. China Fishery Mutual Insurance (CFMI) association has
             realized the importance of insurance awareness and, among other promotional efforts,
             publishes a magazine and releases successful stories to the mass media and social media.
             The fishery extension stations are promoting insurance to fishers and fish farmers and
             conduct visits to successful insurance cases.

             Innovative insurance schemes. Weather-index based insurance (i.e. wind speed and
             temperature) in the People’s Republic of China for seaweeds, mitten crab, and bivalves
             provides indications of technical and economic efficiency of administration, reduction
             of fraud, and proper compensation. The scheme shows its suitability for risks that are
             the direct impacts of climate variability.

             Risk sharing tool instead of disaster relief fund. The Government of the Socialist
             Republic of Viet Nam sought to apply insurance as a strategy to lighten the financial
             burden of government from costly post-disaster assistance. The pilot programme
             insured rice, livestock and aquaculture production against storm, flood, drought, cold,
             frost, tsunami and other perils. It also provided cover against named pests and diseases.

             Farmer resilience. A “cooperative + commercial” model provided incentives for the
             members of the cooperative to reduce losses from disease with better management
             practices. If the total amount of indemnity paid divided by the amount of premium
             collected did not exceed 60 percent, the insurer returned part of the premium to the
             cooperative, which was then distributed among its members for the purchase of water
             quality improvement compounds and other inputs. This illustrates the use of insurance
             as an incentive for investing in improved technology and better practices, which
             improves the farmer’s capacity to adapt to risks.

             Sustainability of the insurance programmes
             Institutional support. The common features of the programmes in the People’s
             Republic of China and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam are strong government support,
             a clear policy, and a state subsidy of premiums. China’s central and local governments
             subsidize 40 to 80 percent of the premium depending on the local government’s financial
             resources. Viet Nam subsidized premiums according to the level of participants’
             household income: 100 percent to poor, 80 percent (revised to 90 percent) to almost
             poor and 60 percent to non-poor households, and 20 percent to organizations or

cooperatives. The common effect of subsidies is that it attracted wider participation.
China’s subsidized programmes have been viable. Viet Nam’s aquaculture pilots
suffered losses, although crop and livestock insurance was profitable.

Institutional infrastructure. China has a mature commercial and mutual insurance
infrastructure. CFMI has a national outreach through near-autonomous offices in
major fishing and fish-farming provinces. The capacity of reinsurers in risk sharing
remains a challenge for the development of aquaculture insurance.

Technical capacity. China’s commercial insurers, aside from having well trained field
operatives, rely on the expertise of fishery and aquaculture cooperatives in risk
identification and assessment. In contrast, in Viet Nam insurance companies did not
coordinate with social organizations — farmers’ associations, women’s associations,
cooperatives, and farmer unions — to develop insurance products that could have
better met the needs of the clients.

CONCLUSIONS
Insurance spreads the cost of insuring climate change-induced risks from aquaculture
farmers to insurers and insurers to reinsurers. Generally, small-scale and medium-scale
farmers’ and fishers’ access to insurance cover is still limited. The reviews suggest
the need for well-designed insurance products that suit the circumstances and needs
of farmers and fishers. Innovative insurance programmes can promote good farm
management practices, and can be seen as a risk mitigation approach. Public-private
partnership models such as mutual insurance can be feasible in providing insurance
services to groups of small farmers. Importantly, government subsidies are needed,
especially during the pilot stage.

ABSTRACT
Communicating the impacts and necessary responses to climate change is a fundamental
building block to informing policy, changing behaviour and reducing vulnerability.
The complex and long-term nature of climate change presents particular challenges
for communicating strategies that ultimately are designed to lead to action to address
climate change and change behaviour to reduce vulnerability. Understanding the
motivations of individuals and their social networks is also critical to how any change
in attitudes and behaviour will ultimately lead to an increase in social resilience.
Communication strategies for ocean acidification (OA) and social marketing to help
restore small-scale fisheries provide some best practices for communicating climate
change and well tested approaches for eliciting behavioural change.

INTRODUCTION
We live in an era that some call the behavioural revolution, which began with the work
of psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s and has since
inspired new fields of research, such as behavioural economics (Thaler, 2015). There
has been a great unfolding of new insights about how people are motivated to make
decisions, along with novel communication techniques and modern technology for
sharing information. Gone are the days of homo economicus — a purely rational and
self-interested utility-maximizer (Bowles and Gintis, 1993). It is now known that many
human decisions are, on the surface, irrational but predictably so (Ariely, 2008); that
human behaviour is more akin to that of ants and honeybees than it is to that of lions
and tigers and bears (Wilson, 2012); and that, perhaps most radical of all, human beings
are much better at cooperating than they are at competing (Bowles and Gintis, 2011).
   Perhaps no other contemporary global challenge than climate change has more
to gain from appreciating this deeper understanding of human behaviour and the
communication techniques that influence it. Recent campaigns by two organizations
provide relevant examples from which we can learn about the opportunity to leverage
novel human behavioural insights for addressing climate change.
   The National Fisheries Conservation Center in the United States started its Global
Ocean Health (GOH) programme in 2007 to communicate the threat of OA and
help stakeholders adapt to, remediate, and mitigate its effects; as well as other climate
impacts on the ocean. Field surveys and modeling confirm that the chemical processes
driving the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 (Sabine et al., 2007) have lowered seawater
pH by 0.1 since 1750, a 30 percent increase in acidity (Feely et al., 2004). This process
of OA is further exacerbated in the Pacific northwest of the United States of America
by the upwelling of carbon-rich waters within the coastal zone, creating “OA hot-
176 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             spots” (Feely et al., 2008). In the late 2000s, the combination of coastal upwelling and
             anthropogenic CO2 uptake caused mass mortality of oyster larvae (Figure 1), triggering
             an “oyster seed crisis” for shellfish growers in Oregon and Washington states. The
             loss of hatchery-produced seed as well as wild oysters triggered extensive economic
             impacts (Washington Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification, 2012).

                 The GOH programme raised funds at the start of the crisis to outfit hatcheries with
             monitoring and buffering equipment, and programme staff served on the world’s first
             Blue Ribbon Panel on Ocean Acidification. Since then, GOH work has been largely
             focused on stakeholder engagement: outreach to those whose livelihoods or way of
             life is threatened by OA and other consequences of a high-carbon ocean. In 2011,
             GOH brought commercial fishermen before the United States Senate to testify about
             the effects of OA, prompting bipartisan support for increased funding. OA is one of
             the fastest-growing fields in oceanography and new research is released daily. These
             studies show that all marine calcifying organisms, including oysters, clam, shrimp,
             lobster, and crabs rely on calcium carbonate availability and are at risk. OA also has
             negative behavioural and recruitment effects on some fish species. A small sea snail, the
             pteropod, may be a key biological indicator of OA and an important warning about
             food web consequences (see Figure 2). More than half of the pteropods collected from
             nearshore waters from central California to the Canadian border are found to have
             severe shell damage caused by OA (Bednarsek et al., 2014). The marine food web
             impacts of impaired pteropods are as yet unknown, but could have widespread effects
             on pink salmon and other key fish species. GOH’s work with shellfish growers, coastal
             communities, and North American Indian tribes has clarified several key lessons
Communicating climate change that leads to action: from awareness to behaviour change        177




regarding communication of climate change, particularly that of OA, with its emphasis
on marine chemistry.

   In another example of climate change communication, experiences from Rare, a
global conservation organization working to promote the adoption of sustainable
small-scale fishing and farming behaviours in Latin America, Asia and Africa, provide
insights on the use of behavioural sciences to improve natural resource management in
ways that can deliver benefits for climate change adaptation. Specifically, behavioural
approaches can build social resilience, help communities adapt to climate change, and
make the link between community engagement and national policy. Such adaptation
and resilience building, done in collaboration with local democratic governance, has
generated demonstrable evidence of changes at the sub-national and national levels.
   Lessons from ocean acidification
   Communicating to people that they have a stake in the health of the ocean and a
reason to care about climate change impacts is key to reaching across boundaries and
breaking through their natural resistance to bad news. In a survey of Oregon shellfish
growers, more than 80 percent indicated that OA will have consequences today, which
is more than four times that of the general public’s perception of the threat (Mabardy
et al., 2015). This demonstrates clearly that when people are conscious of a direct threat
to their livelihood, understanding and acceptance of climate change impacts greatly
increases.
   Research into scientific communication continuously reports that speaking to
people in their own language, telling them a story of a person or people they can
relate to, is significantly more effective than relating scientific concepts in scientific
terms. For GOH, this has been proven repeatedly at workshops and presentations for
northwest Indian tribes, coastal communities who rely on fisheries and reef ecosystems
for tourism, and most significantly, for commercial fishers and shellfish growers in
the United States of America. This last group tends to be made up of largely rural,
politically conservative blue-collar men who are initially resistant to the concept of
climate change. But by telling them the story of the oyster seed crisis — particularly
when it is told by a fellow stakeholder — they are able to put themselves in those
178 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             “threatened” shoes and emerge as strong champions for OA monitoring, research,
             and adaptation funding. Whereas hearing about carbonate chemistry, carbonic acid, or
             aragonite saturation only leads to a glaze-eyed audience being confirmed in its belief
             that climate change and OA are either scientific hoaxes or nothing that they need be
             concerned about.
                GOH has found meetings between these “waterfront champions” and legislators
             or other policymakers to be highly effective. Where the testimony of a thousand
             politically liberal climate change activists has fallen on deaf ears, the voices of a just
             a few fishers who represent a rural conservative constituency as well as millions of
             dollars in economic activity and thousands of jobs, crosses party lines and compels
             legislative action.
                The final piece of communicating climate change impacts — be they OA, sea level
             rise, hypoxia, warming, harmful algal blooms or another threat — is to find the focus
             that will make that subject relevant to the audience. Are they islanders whose shores are
             eroding and who experience constant flooding? Are they a coastal community reliant
             on tourism from coral reefs or recreational shellfish harvest? In 2010, about 40 percent
             of the global population lived in coastal communities (The UN Secretary General
             of the United Nations, 2016), and that number is increasing, making the world’s
             population highly vulnerable to climate impacts. It is critical therefore to identify the
             target audience’s core interests and tailor communications to speak to them.

             Lessons from social marketing and small-scale fisheries
             Increasing the capacity of local communities and fishers to manage their fisheries
             sustainably, conserving critical coastal habitats and strengthening both ecological and
             social resilience will be critical to help people cope with the devastating effects of climate
             change. These vulnerable communities are in greatest need of solutions, which maintain
             or enhance the contribution that fisheries can make to poverty reduction. Three out
             of seven people directly depend on marine and coastal resources to survive, with
             coastal and fishing populations and countries dependent on fisheries being particularly
             vulnerable to climate change (Ban Ki-Moon, 2015). By better understanding human
             beings, in this case small-scale fishers, as social beings and using existing behavioural
             approaches to natural resource management solutions, it is possible to build ecological
             and social resilience to climate change.

             Better understanding of behavioural approaches
             Applying behavioural approaches helps build a holistic understanding of human
             motivation. Through an in-depth diagnosis of, and engagement with, a specific target
             audience it is possible to deploy strategies that promote positive behaviours or social
             norms. These norms are developed to support particular pro-social goals, in this case
             resilience to climate change. The approaches utilize tools and techniques from social
             marketing, social and behaviour change communications, and behavioural economics.
             Rare’s signature behavioural approach is a methodology called PRIDE, which has been
             carefully refined since the early 1980s (Butler et al., 2013). Rather than relying heavily
             on positive or negative extrinsic incentives, like fines or pay-for-performance, a PRIDE
             campaign focuses primarily on inspiring a community to change its own social norms
             around how its natural resources are used in everyday life. This essential logic has now
             been repeated in community-level PRIDE campaigns more than 350 times in over
             50 countries. In each of these places, the approach begins with the same overarching
             theory of how change happens.
                It is important to understand how this translates the features of understanding
             human behaviour, motivation and decision-making into a tactical methodology for
             promoting adoption of a new behavioural norm. It begins with a hypothesis that
             conservation is fundamentally a behavioural problem. Conservation outcomes, whether
Communicating climate change that leads to action: from awareness to behaviour change                                            179




those outcomes are related to species population, habitat quality, or preservation of a
natural resource base, are achieved by reducing existing threats, such as overfishing or
habitat destruction, and those threats are reduced by replacing them with new, more
sustainable behavioural norms.
   The second hypothesis is that a behavioural approach — in this case a PRIDE
campaign — can successfully promote a new behavioural norm among the target
audience, such that those outcomes are ultimately achieved.
   The PRIDE campaign starts with the assumption that knowledge is sometimes a
necessary but almost never a sufficient condition for change (see Figure 3). A certain
level of knowledge and awareness can be raised within the audience, and according to
the PRIDE methodology, the most important types of knowledge are those having to
do with understanding of the solution or new norm itself, and not of the ecological
problem, which is so often the focus of environmental messages.

   A PRIDE campaign also focuses intently on changing attitudes, and in particular
on promoting positive attitudes that are supportive of the new norm. Often this means
identifying and understanding existing shared values within the group and allowing the
group to form attitudes about how those values are tied to the solution.
   One of the most important elements in the campaign is “word of mouth” or
interpersonal communication. This is how social norms diffuse through a group, and
research across virtually all the behavioural and social sciences has demonstrated that
where interpersonal communication, group identity and social cohesion intersect,
cooperation occurs (Janssen and Ostrom, 2008).
   Context is critical, so it is important to go beyond simply inspiring a desire to
adopt a new behavioural norm to actually creating the enabling conditions in which
that behaviour can occur. In the PRIDE methodology, this is referred to as “barrier
removal.” The nature of a campaign’s barrier removal strategy is highly dependent on
the circumstances, but it often involves building technical capacity — from deploying
buoy markers to policy change. Effectively removing barriers allows for easier
adoption of a new behavioural norm.

                 Although Figure 3 lays out these steps in a linear manner that is not generally how
             it is implemented in the real world. For instance, people often talk about things they
             know nothing about, and people often form attitudes based on what they hear while
             communicating in their peer groups.
             To date, these approaches have been focused on the more technical aspects of
             natural resource conservation and management, but these inherently occur in the
             context of a changing climate. Resilience to such change, therefore, is built in a
             number of ways, including:
                 • increasing the readiness with which a community approaches the need to adapt
                    (which reflects both awareness and willingness);
                 • improving the level of trust within and between groups to engage in the
                    cooperation needed to quickly and effectively adapt; and
                 • strengthening the institutions that exist to facilitate effective and rapid decision-
                    making.
                 The following case study outlines how this behavioural approach applied to a
             conservation challenge resulted in positive resilience outcomes for the community of
             Pilar.

             CASE STUDY: PILAR, PHILIPPINES
             In the small community of Pilar in the Cebu province of the central part of the
             Republic of the Philippines, Rare’s partner, the Local Government Unit of Pilar, and
             their campaign leader set out to implement a PRIDE campaign that would change
             the norms around their marine sanctuary (Pilar Municipal Marine Park, a 179 hectare
             near-shore reserve consisting of coral, seagrass and mangrove habitat). In order to
             increase the abundance of fish in the marine park, they needed to reduce intrusions
             into no-take areas and eliminate the use of destructive fishing nets. They needed to
             get the community of fishers more involved in patrolling and enforcing social norms
             around the sanctuary regulations, but more importantly they needed to create a culture
             of compliance amongst the fishers.
                They employed the simple PRIDE methodology (see Figure 3) and developed
             a comprehensive marketing and behavioural change campaign. Extensive target
             audience research was conducted and used to diagnose the prevailing social norms,
             shared values and barriers to change. With that knowledge, a fully branded campaign
             was implemented, targeted toward increasing knowledge of the solution, promoting
             positive normative attitudes, and stimulating interpersonal communication and social
             interaction. This included removing the barriers to change by installing new sinkers
             and buoy markers, and building and repairing guardhouses.
                Although campaign efforts and measurement of outcomes are ongoing, a number
             of positive outcomes have been observed already. Over 18 months, a dramatic shift
             in attitudes about fishing inside the no-take area was observed (Cataylo, 2014).
             Reported sightings of intrusions in the no-take area showed promising decreases, and
             early measurements of biomass changes were equally promising. One of the most
             fundamental shifts was a more cooperative approach to resolving the community’s
             “tragedy of the commons” and working together to sustainably manage their fishery;
             a primary source of protein. In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, demonstrated that
             more than ever, the community was eager for a way to protect their marine resources.
             They had already been building the social trust and institutions to come together, deal
             with the disaster, and move forward.
             As a result of the ongoing campaign, they had:
                • more readiness
                • increased trust
                • improved institutions for decision-making.
Communicating climate change that leads to action: from awareness to behaviour change             181




   Not only did the community have an existing solution that was helping to build
ecological resilience, they now had the necessary elements in place to embrace change,
cope, adapt and prosper in the increasingly intense and more frequent storm events.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Communications targeted at each specific audience can lead to increased understanding
and awareness of complex issues such as OA and climate change. Once people have
overcome their inherent rejection of “bad news” and have come to understand their
stake in the effects of climate change they become effective “champions” capable of
influencing policymakers and decision-makers. Stakeholders that represent significant
economic activity, such as commercial or charter fishers, and who come from a
politically conservative viewpoint can be the strongest influencers of their peers and
legislators.
   Keeping scientific communications in lay terms and avoiding language — particularly
scientific language — unfamiliar to the audience can define the difference between
success and failure. Many scientific communicators are so immersed in their work that
they become unaware of what the larger public is and isn’t familiar with, thus falling
into a trap of communicating in a manner they believe to be clear and concise but
which leaves their audience bemused and befuddled. Communicating OA and other
climate change impacts is best approached with a narrative or story-telling style that
allows the target audience to empathize with the central player(s) and grasp the direct
threat to their own way of life.
   In addition to clear communication strategies such as these that are based on an
understanding of the motivations of individuals and their social networks, it is possible
and necessary to deploy strategies that promote positive behaviours or social norms
that build resilience to climate change. If building ecological and social resilience to
climate change is fundamentally a behavioural problem, then current practices that may
be increasing the vulnerability of a natural resource base need to be replaced with new,
more sustainable and resilient behavioural norms.
   This can be achieved through the use of tools and techniques from social marketing,
social and behaviour change communications, and behavioural economics. PRIDE
campaigns provide one approach that is starting to demonstrate how communities can
move from knowledge and attitudes to specific behaviours that strengthen ecological
and social resilience to climate change. This is being achieved in the case of Pilar
through inter alia by focusing on the promotion of positive attitudes that support
the new norms, ensuring these social norms diffuse throughout the community, and
creating the enabling conditions or “barrier removal” needed for the new behaviour to
occur and be supported.

Impacts of ocean acidification
on shellfish aquaculture on the
west coast of the United States of
America and adaptation responses

Introduction
Oyster growers from Alaska to California on the west coast of the United States of
American (USA) have been challenged in recent years to find seed and oysters to keep
their businesses viable. Scientists from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) and various universities have linked the oyster seed losses to
ocean acidification. Shellfish growers’ understanding of what has caused these oyster
seed shortages and their responses to the issue has evolved in recent years through
seawater monitoring and collaborative research.
   From 2007 to 2009, west coast shellfish growers in the USA experienced a
severe oyster seed shortage. Oyster larvae production at two of the four major seed
production hatcheries declined by approximately 75 percent during this period.
In addition to the drop in hatchery production, there was no significant natural
recruitment of larval oysters in Willapa Bay from 2006 to 2012. Willapa Bay is one of
the largest oyster producing estuaries in the country and many oyster growers rely on
natural recruitment of Pacific oysters to seed their beds. These seed production failures
had a real and profound effect on oyster businesses.

SUMMARY RESULTS
In 2012, the Governor of Washington State appointed an Ocean Acidification Blue
Ribbon Panel to develop a response for the state. This diverse group of shellfish
growers, business representatives, politicians, scientists and environmental non-
government organizations arrived at 42 recommendations for the state, which the
Governor incorporated into an Executive Order for implementation. This response
garnered international recognition as one of the first to address ocean acidification. In
December 2015, through an effort of the Pacific Coast Collaborative, the International
Alliance to Combat Ocean Acidification (OA Alliance) was launched. The OA
Alliance is providing collaboration and tools for countries and affiliates to combat
changing ocean conditions.
   Because of these initiatives, the west coast oyster seed situation has improved. The
outstanding response from policymakers and an unprecedented collaboration between
university, agency and industry scientists has advanced knowledge of the problem
dramatically in a very short period of time. Created by the Washington State Legislature
in 2013, the Marine Resources Advisory Council is overseeing implementation of the
Blue Ribbon Panel’s recommendations. Also created by the Legislature in 2013, the
Washington Ocean Acidification Center at the University of Washington is studying
the effects of ocean acidification on the state’s marine resources. Today, west coast

             shellfish hatcheries in the USA have sophisticated monitoring equipment deciphering
             seawater chemistry sampled from the ocean and automated systems treat the water to
             make it more conducive to oyster larvae survival.
                 In addition to the monitoring systems in the hatcheries, equipment has been added
             to several buoys that are part of NOAA’s Integrated Ocean Observation System
             (IOOS). This allows shellfish growers and scientists to understand changes in ocean
             carbonate chemistry around the hatcheries and farms. Five of the IOOS regions in
             the Pacific Ocean have linked to provide one data portal, the IOOS Pacific Region
             OA data Portal15 that delivers data from all five regions. This online portal provides
             live real time data from various government, academic and Native American facilities
             and buoys including five major west coast shellfish hatcheries. On a larger scale, the
             Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON)16 is working to gather
             and exchange ocean acidification data internationally.
                 As a result of these responses, oyster production has improved, at least temporarily
             for shellfish growers. Hatchery production has largely recovered and ocean conditions
             have resulted in some limited natural oyster seed recruitment in Willapa Bay since
             2012. Although oyster seed supplies have improved, they are still not adequate to meet
             all growers’ needs.

             WHAT DO WEST COAST SHELLFISH GROWERS KNOW ABOUT OCEAN
             ACIDIFICATION THAT THEY DIDN’T A FEW YEARS AGO?
             Initial efforts to determine the causes of oyster larvae losses focused on the naturally
             occurring bacteria Vibrio coralliilyticus (initially misidentified at V. tubiashi). These
             bacteria thrive in the water conditions created by upwelling off the west coast of the
             USA. Filtration systems were designed and installed to eliminate the bacteria, however
             oyster larvae continued to die. In 2008, NOAA ocean acidification experts informed
             shellfish growers that the likely cause of the oyster larvae deaths was changing seawater
             chemistry resulting from the ocean absorbing anthropogenic carbon dioxide.
                The ocean absorbs approximately 30 percent of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide
             emitted into the atmosphere. This results in the formation of carbonic acid, which
             reduces the ocean pH making it more acidic. Since the industry became aware that
             ocean acidification may be the cause of the hatchery issues, operators with the help of
             university scientists have identified the availability of carbonate ions as most critical.
             They are the building blocks for the oyster shells and carbon ion availability diminishes
             as the ocean acidifies.
                The carbon dioxide from 250 years of burning fossil fuels has made the ocean
             surface waters more acidic and reduced the availability of carbonate ions by 16 percent.
             By the end of this century, scientists predict the acidity of the ocean surface waters will
             have increased by 100 percent to 150 percent and reduced carbonate ion availability
             by 50 percent. A more troubling message for shellfish growers from scientists is that
             water currently upwelling off the west coast is 30 to 50 years old. So even if carbon
             dioxide emissions were curtailed today, the waters along the Washington State coast
             will continue to become more acidic for decades because of the residual effects of the
             carbon dioxide already absorbed by the Pacific Ocean.
                Shellfish growers have now come to understand through monitoring and research
             that natural factors associated with summer upwelling off the west coast can result
             in ocean chemistry conditions detrimental to the development and growth of oyster
             larvae. Research suggests these conditions occurred about 11 percent of the time prior
             to the industrial revolution. Corrosive events for oyster larvae are now happening an
             estimated 33 percent of the time and are more severe when they occur.

   Taylor Shellfish Farms has a second hatchery in the State of Hawaii that hasn’t
experienced the same ocean acidification related problems. As an additional adaption
response to larval failures in the Washington State hatchery, the company has expanded
production capacity at the hatchery in Hawaii. In 2012, another Washington State
shellfish farming business, Goose Point Oyster Company started up a hatchery in
Hawaii also in response to the west coast oyster seed shortage.
   Currently, west coast shellfish growers have found a temporary solution to the
impacts of ocean acidification by treating hatchery water to restore larval production.
Juvenile and adult oysters on farms in the estuaries have not yet been visibly impacted.
Growers expect under increasing ocean acidification that shellfish in the nurseries and
on beds will eventually be impacted as well. Unlike in the hatcheries, there is no way
to control the seawater chemistry over thousands of acres of beds in the ocean. To
address this vulnerability the University of Washington and Oregon State University
are working with shellfish growers to determine if selective breeding may yield
oysters that can tolerate reduced levels of carbonate ions. Research is also underway
to determine if culturing seaweed together with shellfish or culturing shellfish in or
around seagrass beds may buffer acidic seawater and provide a refuge for the shellfish
by naturally reducing carbon dioxide concentrations and increasing carbonate ion
availability.
   All these actions demonstrate measures that the shellfish industry is using to adapt
to changing seawater chemistry.

WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE SHELLFISH
INDUSTRY?
The response from policymakers and scientists to date has been proactive and effective.
Washington State Governor and the Legislature continue to fund the Marine Resources
Advisory Council and the University of Washington’s Ocean Acidification Center.
   The science on ocean acidification is rapidly evolving and having a coordinated
review and response by the Marine Resources Advisory Committee is critical. Efforts
to expand this coordination throughout the west coast are underway and similar efforts
are being undertaken on the east coast of the USA. Continued monitoring and the
development of predictive models are also key for managing an adaptive industry.
   It is important to remember the impacts of ocean acidification extend well beyond
shellfish. They are just one of many calcifying organisms in the ocean likely being
affected by changing ocean chemistry. In addition, scientists are finding other
detrimental impacts beyond calcification. The governance, coordination and adaptation
responses for the west coast shellfish industry17 can be applied to other aquaculture
ventures and fisheries that face similar climate change impacts.

ABSTRACT
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change provides guidance
on gender equality but this is poorly developed and often ignored in fisheries and
aquaculture climate change adaptation. This omission arises because of weak national
support generally for action on gender equality, a low priority accorded to it in
fisheries and aquaculture, and a technical discourse on climate change in fisheries and
aquaculture that appears to necessitate technical solutions. The present paper addresses
gender equality in climate adaptation in the sector. It uses secondary sources and the
authors’ first-hand research experiences related to climate and other anthropogenic
and natural disasters. Many of the studies were presented in the Asian Fisheries
Society gender symposia and in “FishAdapt: the global conference on climate change
adaptation for fisheries and aquaculture”. Supplemental insights from forestry and land
use were also used. The analyses found that existing social and fisheries sector norms
constrain gender equality, resulting in low participation by women in formal and
informal institutions, and restricting the ability to respond to climate change in gender-
sensitive ways. Data weaknesses and a lack of knowledge of gender in the economy
and society compound the problems. When gender is addressed, the rationale often is
190 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             women’s vulnerability, but this downplays women’s agency, and may exclude women
             from participating in consultations. Alternately, portraying women as “virtuous
             players” can overload them with additional adaptation responsibilities, unless current
             gender roles and relations in society are transformed.
                Fisheries vulnerability assessments often ignore gender, potentially omitting key
             vulnerability issues and data on informal producers and workers in parts of the fish
             value chain where women dominate. In relevant vulnerability and other studies, a
             gender lens has exposed issues that were otherwise ignored, has permitted better
             targeting of interventions and has highlighted new intervention options. Gender-blind
             actions have risked exacerbating existing inequalities, e.g. in cash transfers. Because
             nearly half the fish value chain workers are women, their contributions are critical
             in sustaining household and national economies. Gender-sensitive research has also
             demonstrated the importance of diversified livelihoods in coping with disasters and
             declining resources.
                Because the findings from vulnerability assessments are used to frame the agenda
             when developing national adaptation plans, as well as sectoral plans and adaptation
             projects, they should incorporate gender indicators and be used to inform gender-
             responsive budgets. The gender priorities need to go beyond simply a focus on
             women and recognize the complexity of gender roles and relations. To be able to
             integrate gender into their climate adaptation operations, fisheries and aquaculture
             institutions will need to be transformed, educate their staff in basic gender equality
             concepts, and employ gender experts and champions to provide fair solutions for
             women and men.

             INTRODUCTION
             Climate change can have impacts on aquatic ecosystems, and thus the communities
             that depend on fisheries and aquaculture for food security and poverty reduction are
             the most threatened (Monnereau et al., 2017). In general, climate change adaptation
             provides a framework to address the negative impacts of climate change on ecosystems
             and people (both men and women). In the case of fisheries and aquaculture however,
             gender equity and equality principles as well as gender-sensitive approaches are missing
             in most undertakings on climate change adaptation, despite long-standing concerns
             that disasters tend to have differential impacts on women and men (Wiest et al., 1994).
             Although not addressed in fisheries and aquaculture, these concerns are reflected
             in instruments of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
             (UNFCCC), such as the advice to developing countries to incorporate gender equality
             terminology when formulating national adaptation plans (UNFCCC, 2012).
                Women make up nearly half the workforce in the fisheries and aquaculture value
             chain (FAO, 2016) but they and their work are under-recognized. Indeed, they are
             not perceived as important players by a public more familiar with masculine images
             of fishers. The actual number of women is underestimated in most statistics, especially
             because reports on the sector tend to focus only on the number of people directly
             engaged in fish production (10.7 million women representing 19 percent of 56.6 million
             workers), rather than on all those in the value chain where, according to 2014 estimates,
             nearly 50 percent are women (FAO, 2016). Also, the estimate of the number of
             workers in direct production does not include many women in non-formal work such
             as shellfish gatherers (Harper et al., 2013; Kleiber et al., 2015), others excluded by
             regulations from registering as professional fishers, and homestead-based fish farmers.
             In pre-harvest and post-harvest activities, women have traditionally dominated input
             supplies, processing and trading (Weeratunge et al., 2010). This less visible work sharply
             raises the total proportion of women in fisheries to half the workforce but in most cases
             the focus is still on production rather than on the whole value chain. The production
             focus and the masculine culture that shape the discourse on fisheries development lead

to few women participating in decision-making and relegates gender equality to a low
order issue, including in the nexus between fisheries and climate change adaptation.
   The discourse of climate change adaptation in fisheries and aquaculture is inherently
technical, appearing to necessitate technical solutions. This leaves little room to
incorporate gender and social issues and is compounded by the patriarchy inherent
in societies. Fisheries and gender experts, however, observe progress, albeit slow, in
getting gender into the fisheries agenda (Williams and Choo, 2014; Gopal et al., 2016).
In 2014, the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the
Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (FAO, 2015) became the first global
fisheries policy to include a gender equality objective.

METHODS
The present study used evidence from secondary sources and the authors’ own
knowledge and experiences to examine how gender is considered (or ignored despite
the prevailing guidance from formal higher-level instruments) in fisheries and
aquaculture climate change adaptation, and the ways in which gender-sensitive action
can support adaptation. These findings are supplemented by the lessons learned from
forestry and land use sectors.
   The first source was the UNFCCC guidance on gender for drafting the national
adaptation plans of action (NAPA). The NAPA were directed to address urgent and
immediate needs to adapt to climate change in the least developed countries (LDCs).
Since 2010, UNFCCC guidance for adaptation planning has been through the long-
term national adaptation plan (NAP) process for LDCs, and other developing countries
in general. This source was used to gauge the extent to which the broader guidance on
climate change adaptation supported or mandated taking gender into account.
   The second source of material was selected fisheries and aquaculture vulnerability
assessments for climate change adaptation. These were examined for the extent to
which they incorporated gender analysis and used the findings to inform priority
setting and project designs.
   The third source was the research on gender in fisheries and aquaculture spanning
more than 20 years that was presented in 11 Asian Fisheries Society (AFS) gender
symposia. These research studies were used to gain an understanding of how gender
is being addressed in conditions of resource distress and to determine the lessons
learned. Reflecting the state of research on gender and climate change adaptation, these
symposia contained few papers directly addressing climate change adaptation, and
therefore studies on the following were also included: impacts and recovery efforts
from natural and anthropogenic disasters, such as typhoons, the 2004 Indian Ocean
tsunami, floods and the Philippine oil spill from the MT Solar I. These disasters had
immediate and long-term impacts on people, and acted on a similar scale and in a
similar manner as many effects of climate change. Emerging patterns from the data are
discussed and analysed by the authors with experience in fisheries and supplemented
by findings emerging from the forestry and the other land use sectors (Christie and
Giri, 2011; WOCAN, UN-REDD and LEAF, 2013).
   From the 11 women/gender in fisheries and aquaculture symposia held by the AFS
from 1990 to 2016, 230 items were examined, comprising 172 published papers and
58 presentations from the most recent event, and relevant papers from the FishAdapt
Conference. The AFS events are the only continuous series of women/gender events
in the fisheries sector and reflect the state of research in the field. The articles covered
work in all geographic regions, although with a preponderance of studies from Asia and
the Pacific. Twenty relevant papers were found, the earliest of which was from 2007.
From 2013, the AFS Global Symposia on Gender in Aquaculture and Fisheries (GAF)
began holding thematic sessions, including on sectoral change and climate change, and
the impacts of disasters, namely: Gendered Change (2013, GAF4), Climate Change
192 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             and Natural Disasters (2014, GAF5), and Climate Change and Disaster Preparedness
             (2016, GAF6).
                Despite the paucity of material on climate change and natural disasters from these
             symposia, they represent nearly 10 percent of the total number of published papers,
             indicating that funding for projects on climate change and disaster relief has provided
             significant opportunities for gender research.

             RESULTS

             Women in fisheries and aquaculture are not just climate victims but change
             agents
             The counsel on the importance of taking account of gender in emergency relief arose at
             least 23 years ago when Wiest et al. (1994) chronicled the needs of women in disasters
             and emergencies. These authors underscored that nuanced and gender-sensitive
             approaches were important in disaster response and recovery. Today, with heightened
             and widespread risks brought about by anthropogenic climate change, evidence is still
             being gathered to strengthen the argument that environmental events have differential
             impacts on women and men, particularly those depending on natural resources. In
             general, research on the gender dimensions of climate change has developed more
             slowly than general social research on climate risks and adaptation (McGregor, 2010).
             In any sector, gender is treated belatedly, only addressed after other priorities. This is
             related to the masculine culture of the sectors of fisheries and aquaculture that gives
             little importance to gender equality.
                 Feminist critiques of climate change discourse have recently permeated academic
             and policy circles, including to some extent in fisheries and aquaculture, with women’s
             vulnerability as the entry point or rallying cry. The arguments on the gender dimension
             of climate change have their strengths and weaknesses. They often focus on the fact
             that women and girls make up a disproportionate number of the poor or marginalized
             who are greatly affected by climate variability and/or they focus on women as virtuous
             and pro-environment (Arora-Jonsson, 2011).
                 When portrayed as passive victims of climate change, women are perceived as not
             being able to play an active role in policymaking. This can result in a lack of women’s
             participation, lack of gender considerations in vulnerability and adaptive capacity
             assessments, and in gender-blind climate change mitigation and adaptation policies
             (Denton, 2002 and Shanthi et al., 2016a). In coastal and inland aquatic systems,
             women are particularly invisible in management decision-making and during coastal
             emergencies standard institutional responses follow top-down militaristic traditions
             without regard for power differentials that leave certain groups marginalized (Badayos-
             Jover and Defiesta 2014). Proponents of the vulnerability argument call for positive
             discrimination approaches to remedy the status quo. The “virtue” argument highlights
             the agency of women as change agents and champions for climate change. Proponents
             posit that women, despite the complex climate problems, find ways to cope and find
             solutions. They call for tailored support that taps women’s virtue and uses it as a force
             against the negative impacts of climate change.

             Gender equality needs effective inclusion in global and national policy
             instruments
             In the global policy instruments on climate change adaptation, gender equality was
             first mentioned in 2001 as one of the ten guiding elements of the national adaptation
             programmes of action (UNFCCC, 2001), but more specific guidance was slow to
             follow. In 2012, the UNFCCC included gender considerations in its primary technical
             guidelines for the NAP process (UNFCCC, 2012). These guidelines recommended
             that the NAPs should follow a country-driven, gender-sensitive, participatory and
Gender as the missing link for improving climate change adaptation in fisheries and aquaculture   193




fully transparent approach, taking into account vulnerable groups, communities and
ecosystems. The guidelines acknowledge women’s historical disadvantages, their
limited participation in decision-making and limited access to natural resources
despite their dependency on these assets. The guidelines also provide advice on how
to integrate gender perspectives into the NAP process: by focusing on the equal
participation of women and men in decision-making, harnessing women’s involvement
in climate-sensitive work, including in fisheries, and in general in the implementation
of adaptation activities.
   Since 2015, the Green Climate Fund of the UNFCCC created a new incentive
for incorporating gender by mandating a strong gender policy (Green Climate Fund
Board, 2015). Despite this and the good intentions of the guidelines, constraints
include weak national gender equality action, poor supporting structures and capacity,
and strong underlying social norms that resist changes in established gender power
relations. In the NAPs, the extent of integration needs to be evaluated using gender-
sensitive indicators and gender-responsive budgeting.
   In fisheries and aquaculture, climate change adaptation activities rarely integrate
gender. Currently, climate change adaptation activities mainly focus on performing
vulnerability assessments at national or local scales. Gender and gender analysis
have been included in the FAO review of methodologies for fish sector vulnerability
assessments, but in practice few vulnerability assessments address gender or women,
e.g. only one of the six case studies in the FAO review (Brugère and De Young, 2015)
does so. The one exception was the pilot study using participatory community level
assessments in the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem countries (Raemaekers
and Sowman, 2015). The pilot study offered examples of how, in participatory
processes, the vulnerability issues raised depended on which groups took part. For
example, in Doringbaai, the Republic of South Africa, where women participated in
stakeholder meetings, only they mentioned food security as a climate change impact,
and they were markedly more concerned than men about drug and alcohol abuse, and
unemployment.
   In examining the vulnerability assessment ratings for small-island developing states
(SIDS), Monnereau et al. (2017) found that the relative ratings depended critically on
the choice of methods and data. Vulnerability assessments and project planning that
ignore gender, therefore, may be flawed in their quantitative and qualitative outputs.
For example, Monnereau et al. (2017) found vastly different national vulnerability
scores depending on whether data for number of “fishers” were given as raw numbers
or scaled by population size. They did not, however, also take into account how the
estimates may have differed depending on the definition of “fishers.” Were “fishers”
only those engaged in primary production or those in the whole value chain? The total
number of workers in the value chain, including estimates for informal fishers and
secondary sector workers, would appear to be a more realistic indicator of a sector’s
importance, especially if also adjusted to produce a better estimate of the numbers in
the informal economy.
   To derive more accurate numbers for quantitative vulnerability assessments, and
connect these to sensitivities to climate change requires knowledge of gendered
patterns of work and how each type of work is exposed and sensitive to different
climate change factors, for example, the availability of water and energy for drying
fish. Sumagaysay (2016) pointed out the food-water-energy nexus confronting women
fish dryers in Barangay Duljugan in Palompon, Leyte, the Republic of Philippines,
detailing the water and energy needs of each stage of drying and how climate change
affects the nexus, and ultimately the livelihoods and adaptation strategies that women
have to undertake.

             Lessons from 20 years of gender research in fisheries and aquaculture
             From the 20 relevant papers presented in the gender in aquaculture and fisheries
             (GAF) symposia, and other selected literature, three key lessons have been learned:
             (1) a gender lens makes a difference; (2) gender-blind responses overlook adaptation
             potential; and (3) diversity and flexibility in livelihoods helps adaptation.

             1. A gender lens makes a difference
             Scholars working on the intersections of gender and fisheries use a gender lens to map
             out women’s, men’s, and young people’s work, going beyond simple fish production
             to include value chains, gendered resource use and even gendered emotional responses
             to climate risks (e.g. Bagsit, 2014; Lebel and Lebel, 2016; Pedroza-Gutiérrez, 2016;
             Sumagaysay, 2016). In fisheries, the use of a gender lens allows a focus on issues that
             would otherwise be missed because of stereotypical assumptions (Williams, 2008).
                Gender analysis also improves the targeting of beneficiaries (Defiesta and Badayos-
             Jover, 2014) and emphasizes the need to include women in various levels of decision-
             making, such as when determining criteria for paid work in rehabilitation (Badayos-
             Jover and Defiesta, 2014).
                To enable women to articulate their needs in emergencies, researchers in the
             Republic of Philippines provided venues for women to express their agency. In
             an island-barangay (coastal village) in northern Iloilo in the aftermath of the 2013
             Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), women requested disaster aid specifically for women, and
             separate from the usual fishing boats given by donors to male fishers (Badayos-Jover,
             2016). The women’s clamour highlighted the prevalent mismatch between community-
             defined needs and institutional interventions, something that could be averted if gender
             analyses were routinely employed in efforts to combat the effects of climate change in
             resource-driven communities.
                Adaptation strategies must be based on the understanding of context specific
             vulnerabilities that vary across genders and phases of the disaster and recovery. In
             Typhoon Yolanda, for example, more men died, went missing or were injured than
             women, probably because many did not shelter in evacuation centres, preferring to
             try to save their homes and property. After a disaster, however, several studies in the
             Republic of Philippines have shown that many men left their households to search for
             jobs, leaving women to fend for the family and cope with the extensive damage to the
             houses and communities. Women have frequently risen on their own and developed
             coping strategies for dealing with these situations (Badayos-Jover and Defiesta, 2014;
             Defiesta and Badayos-Jover, 2014; Bagsit, 2014). A better understanding could have
             aided the women with better strategies and improved access to assistance to speed the
             recovery process.
                Climate change adaptation plans should address the lack of access by women and
             men in fisheries to universal social protection schemes, which are already weak in the
             sectors of fisheries and aquaculture, and the development of targeted schemes that
             address specific vulnerabilities (Bene et al., 2015). For example, in the Republic of
             Philippines during Typhoon Yolanda a lesson on the need for family planning services
             during emergencies was learned when couples in the evacuation centres requested pills
             and condoms. Subsequently, an Administrative Order was promulgated making family
             planning services (at a minimum, pills and condoms in evacuation centres) part of the
             disaster response.
                At each stage of the fish value chain, women and men are vulnerable to risks
             associated with the type of activity in which they are engaged. During harvesting,
             fishing is a very dangerous occupation and fishers are vulnerable to storms and strong
             waves that lead to accidents and even loss of lives. When a fisher is injured or dies, the
             burden of raising the family falls on the wife or partner. For their part, women engage
             in gleaning and collecting shells, invertebrates and seaweed in intertidal and inshore
Gender as the missing link for improving climate change adaptation in fisheries and aquaculture   195




areas, making them vulnerable to injuries, illness and changes caused by climate change.
Women involved in smoking and drying fish are exposed to occupational illnesses
which could be debilitating and shorten their lives. In marketing and distribution,
women and men are exposed to the dangers of travel as they bring the fish from the
landing site to the market.
   Despite the risks, fishers frequently lack access to health services and social
protection, for example, pensions, social insurance, and unemployment benefits that
could help them and their families get by during times of illness, bad weather, and the
death of a family member. Less visible fishing activities undertaken by women, such as
gleaning, put them at a further disadvantage because they cannot get access to health
insurance and retirement benefits that may otherwise be available to fishers and other
recognized occupational groups.
   The phenomenon of “sex for fish” is one example of complex fish value chain risks
that could be increased by climate change. The impact of the high prevalence rate of
HIV/AIDS in some fishing communities was first brought to the attention of the
fisheries sector in the 2001 GAF Symposium (Williams et al., 2002) and expanded on
by Allison and Seeley (2004) and FAO (undated). Multiple risk factors include the
fishers’ mobility, risk-taking behaviour and use of alcohol and drugs, lack of access
to health services, easy access to commercial sex in landing sites and the phenomenon
of sex-for-fish (Béné and Merten, 2008), where a woman’s access to fish is governed
by her sexual relationship with male fishers. The literature on sex-for-fish points to
at least three explanations: poverty and marginalization forcing women into coercive
sexual relationships; their lack of negotiating power with male fishers and women’s
subordinate position in society; and women’s agency whereby they knowingly use
sexual favours to get access to fish that they need for their livelihoods. An additional
factor is the deteriorating condition of fishing grounds, driving fishers to follow
the fish and keeping them away from home for long periods, leading to new sexual
relationships and disease risks (Mojola, 2011). This last is pertinent to the impact
of climate change on fisheries, because lower abundance of fish and altered fish
distribution patterns potentially also change relations in fishing communities. Any
discussion therefore regarding climate change adaptation plans needs to use a gender
lens to understand why the practice of sex-for-fish persists, and to address this.

2. Gender-blind approaches overlook adaptation potential
In recent decades in all economic sectors, women’s participation in the labour market
has increased, as has their participation as entrepreneurs and business owners. Currently
women comprise 40 percent of the world labour force (World Bank, 2011). However,
women are paid less and are more likely to engage in low-productivity activities and
to work in the informal sector. If women were able to develop their full labour market
potential, the macroeconomic gains would be significant (World Bank, 2011).
   In gender-blind approaches, the role of women is commonly ignored or
underestimated in the economy. Given the growing role of women in the economy as
well as in other social sectors, the advantages that women’s participation can have in
climate change adaptation must be recognized. This is particularly critical in the fish
sector where women make up nearly half the workforce but because of the informal
nature of small-scale fisheries, they are overlooked, at times resulting in labour
instability and work-based risks (Godoy, 2016).
   Women and the community suffered doubly from gender-blind relief and
rehabilitation after the 2006 Solar I oil spill in Guimaras, the Republic of Philippines.
The rehabilitation efforts were publicly promoted as fair for families, but, in reality,
women received a smaller share of cash and relief benefits despite the fact that their
inshore fishing areas were more damaged for longer than those of the men (Defiesta
and Badayos-Jover, 2014).
196 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




                To avoid gender-blind action, appropriate tools are needed. In Tamil Nadu, the
             Republic of India, a new handbook was designed to undertake socio-economic and
             gender analysis (SEAGA) to assess the impact of environmental changes on coastal
             women (Shanthi et al., 2016b). The handbook provides a gender-sensitive approach
             to climate adaptation and was based on experience gained from long-running practical
             studies to assist the Tamil Nadu women. Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and
             SEAGA were used to study the impact of environmental changes on the livelihoods
             of women and men, the village environment, the village infrastructure and institutions,
             gender and social issues in fisheries and aquaculture (Shanthi et al., 2016a).
                FAO has prepared a handbook to support gender-equitable small-scale fisheries
             governance and development in the context of the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing
             the Sustainability of Small-scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty
             Alleviation (SSF Guidelines) (FAO, 2015). The SSF Guidelines are the first global
             instrument to include a gender equality objective as well as having a separate chapter
             addressing disaster risks and climate change.
                Gender training is another instrument to sensitize planners and project developers.
             As a strategy, it should be part of the education system for students. One such example
             is the course on gender that the Central Institute for Fisheries Education (Indian
             Council of Agricultural Research), Mumbai, is delivering in its mainstream academic
             curriculum for fisheries students.

             3. Diversification in livelihoods helps adaptation
             Despite a lack of recognition, as in other economic sectors, women’s work in fisheries
             and aquaculture is becoming more diverse and more important for the sustainability
             of these sectors, and as part of the adaptation and coping strategies in the face of
             climate change. Women’s participation in the value chain is crucial in facing the
             new fisheries conditions created by climate change and scarcity. In capture fisheries,
             women target different species, and in the processing phase their work dominates
             value addition and product diversification. This is very important in designing new
             food and market approaches to face the new challenges. Administration and trading
             are other activities where women work, and which are also among the key elements
             that need to be addressed to diversify and keep the sector sustainable. For example, in
             Petatán on Lake Chapala in Mexico, declining water levels pose a threat to the fishery.
             Women have adapted by filleting low value tilapia and carp harvested there and from
             elsewhere, keeping the commercial fisheries afloat by adding value and making the fish
             marketable. They also earn reasonable incomes for themselves and their households
             (Predroza-Gutiérrez, 2016).
                 Flexible approaches to livelihood choices can help adaptation to climate change.
             In coastal districts of Tamil Nadu, South India, this has been well illustrated by
             studies and practical help to coastal women of the Irular tribal group given post-
             tsunami assistance (Shanthi et al., 2016a). With the help of researchers from the
             Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture (Indian Council of Agricultural
             Research) and women’s self help groups, women learned and adopted a range of new
             livelihoods. These included rural government and private sector employment, small-
             scale aquaculture of crabs and sea bass, service industries such as fish feed manufacture,
             as well as continuing their previous fisheries labouring livelihoods that are mainly
             seasonal. With the new diversity of livelihoods, women achieved greater stability in
             income, and enhanced group savings that were reinvested in aquaculture. After the
             interventions, certain social taboos, including that women should not participate in
             meetings outside their villages, were overcome as some women travelled to market
             their crabs. The researchers also benefited from innovative ideas on the aquaculture
             trials, which then created a platform for other organizations such as state government
             departments, private entrepreneurs and NGOs to sustain the support.
Gender as the missing link for improving climate change adaptation in fisheries and aquaculture   197




DISCUSSION
The formal commitment to making climate change adaptation gender-sensitive was
first mooted in 2001 in the global climate change adaptation policies18. Gender equality,
however, only firmly entered the adaptation dialogue about ten years later and has
yet to be fully embraced in planning and action. Existing social norms constrain
gender equality action because most societies and institutions are patriarchal. The low
participation of women in decision-making in both formal and informal structures has
adverse implications on the ability to respond to climate change in gender-sensitive
ways. The NAPs could be expected to struggle with incorporating gender equality
principles and even participatory development processes may gloss over underlying
gender biases. This situation is exacerbated by data weaknesses and a lack of knowledge
of gendered patterns of economic and social roles. If women’s vulnerability is the
rationale for targeting women, then women’s agency may be downplayed, along
with their more complex individual and community needs. Women are then denied
their voice and can be left out of consultations. Or, equally, if women are considered
“virtuous actors”, they can be overloaded with additional responsibilities in adaptation
actions, unless current gender roles and relations are transformed.
    Similar or greater challenges exist in fisheries and aquaculture, known for their
masculine cultures and relatively recent attention to gender, e.g. 2015 SSF Guidelines.
Despite the slow progress being made on “the long journey to gender equality” (Gopal
et al., 2016; Williams and Choo, 2014), a few encouraging steps have been taken
specifically to make climate change adaptation activities more gender equal.
    Progress is possible if gender analysis is applied in the vulnerability assessments
now being used as the entry point for climate change adaptation action. A gender lens
used in the design and conduct of the assessments would bring the whole value chain
into focus, can highlight women’s roles and risks associated with fisheries sectors, and
may also strengthen the case for adaptation action. A gender lens changes a person’s
perspectives, and enables one to re-learn their discipline/sector, this time to include all
the stakeholders and lead to policies that are gender-responsive. Using a clear gender
lens when carrying out stakeholder analysis would ensure that nobody is left behind
and would sharpen the focus on the similarities and differences in the vulnerabilities
faced by women and men. These results can then be used to inform the planning
processes for NAPs, including fisheries adaptation planning, further strengthening
gender-integrated solutions for the fisheries sector and beyond.
    For inclusiveness and gender sensitivity, however, tokenism should be avoided and
women must not be portrayed in clichéd ways, e.g. using vulnerability/virtue theories.
Qualitative social studies, based on well-considered theory must also be part of using
a gender lens to gain a clearer perception of the issues, setting in motion the thinking
process on the “whys” (Porter and Hapke, 2016). Fisheries and aquaculture can learn
from good practices in forestry and other land use sectors that are more codified than
in fisheries and aquaculture. These practices include ensuring women’s representation
and participation with legal mandates, skills building, gender-disaggregated analysis
and planning to meet women’s livelihoods needs, gender champions, women’s
networks, labour-saving and time-reducing technologies, equitable benefit sharing,
and enterprise development opportunities (WOCAN, UN-REDD and LEAF, 2013).
    Although the fisheries and aquaculture literature on climate change contains very
few studies that focus on the gender implications of climate change, awareness is
growing that the gender dimension is crucial in understanding issues and their impacts
on communities and local economies (Gopal et. al., 2016). As natural resource systems
become more severely affected by climate change, the challenge remains to include
the people experiencing the impacts of these changes and evolving adaptive strategies

             especially for fishing communities. The persistent use of gender-blind responses
             is dangerous for the sustainability of the sector, and restricts the possibilities of
             livelihoods opportunities for both women and men in fishing communities.

             CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
             Starting from the authors’ knowledge of gender in fisheries and graduating to
             incorporating the gender dimensions in climate change adaptation discussions, this
             paper makes clear that in the fisheries and aquaculture sector gender is an important
             factor. However, limited studies and tools are currently available on gender and
             climate change. Now is the time to have wider discussions on how to ensure gender
             mainstreaming in climate change adaptation so as to set in motion a process to define
             the present “stocktaking” moment and begin to progress and enhance future climate
             action. In principle, gender could be integrated relatively easily into, for example,
             stakeholder and livelihoods analyses when new gender tools are developed and widely
             tested. However, planners have to be aware that equal participation in terms of numbers
             is not sufficient to address women’s concerns. Gender expertise must be integral to
             projects and policymaking so that the practical and strategic needs of women and men
             are given due consideration. Gender-aware action will require transformed institutions
             capable of integrating gender into adaptation initiatives, and prepared to allocate a
             gender-responsive budget, and respond to indicators.
                For more than 20 years the authors of the present paper have conducted women/
             gender in aquaculture and fisheries events within mainstream fisheries and aquaculture
             conferences. For a decade, the authors have encouraged researchers to integrate gender
             into climate change adaptation, and natural and anthropogenic disaster recovery. In a
             parallel world, experts such as those in the Global Partnership for Climate, Fisheries
             and Aquaculture (PACFA) working on climate change adaptation in fisheries and
             aquaculture have endeavoured to draw attention to the need for action. To date, they
             have focused mainly on biophysical changes and vulnerability assessments, including
             some socio-economic elements. The vulnerability assessments, with a few exceptions,
             are gender-blind, ignoring gender issues and lacking gender-disaggregated data. To
             make progress, those responsible for fisheries and aquaculture adaptation efforts must
             broaden their agendas to fully integrate gender, and not just through a focus on women
             but with a true recognition of the social complexity of gender. This also means that
             adaptation experts should be educated on basic gender concepts, preferably starting
             with their basic fisheries education, and priority should be given to employing gender
             experts rather than relying on hiring short-term gender consultants.
                In addition to hiring gender experts in institutions, fisheries sector climate change
             adaptation and gender players need to identify, develop and empower gender champions
             in institutions and communities. Many of the champions will be women but men,
             equally, must be included. Grassroots women, the gender champions, and the experts
             could give voice to gender issues such as the shortcomings of gender-blind planning in
             national climate policies and agenda, the benefits of context-specific, gender inclusive
             disaster preparedness and recovery and focus on diversity in livelihood options.

ABSTRACT
This paper aims to bring focus to the Asia-Pacific region and to how countries can
address the priority actions for fisheries and aquaculture incorporated into their
respective Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) under the Paris
Agreement on climate change. The importance of the fisheries and aquacultures sectors
in the region is significant in terms of food and nutrition security, trade, livelihoods
and the economy, especially so for the large numbers of small-scale fishers and
fish farmers. However, the fisheries and aquaculture sectors are generally not well
represented in national climate change planning forums, and especially so in some
countries where the sectors are important. Based on a review of country priorities for
fisheries and aquaculture in the INDC from countries in the region and on associated
planning documents, a number of key messages have been developed, including how
to incorporate better these sectors into future national, regional and global actions so
as to address climate change impacts and their drivers.

INTRODUCTION
Fisheries and aquaculture make a significant contribution to food and nutrition security
and the livelihoods of millions of people in the Asia-Pacific region (FAO, 2016). There
are about 48 million people (87 percent of the global total) engaged in fisheries and
aquaculture production with an estimated 170 million directly and indirectly engaged in
the value chain. More than 90 percent of the region’s capture fishers are small-scale fishers.
The amount of fish that people consume continues to rise and averaged more than 19 kg/
capita per year in 2012. Women play a key role in the fisheries sector in the region. The
key contributions the sector makes are to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), livelihoods,
trade (the most traded commodity in the world), employment and food and nutrition
security. The sector can also contribute to gender inclusiveness and poverty alleviation.
   In the last 20 years, globally and regionally, capture fisheries production has
levelled off with a concomitant increase in the number of fisheries and stocks classified
204 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             as overexploited (FAO, 2016). The reasons for this include increased fishing effort,
             improved technology, increased trade, increased pollution and habitat modification.
             By contrast, aquaculture production continues to increase and by 2014 had exceeded
             that of capture fisheries in the Asia-Pacific region (Figure 1).

                Ensuring sustainable fisheries and the sustainable development of aquaculture in
             the region will be a significant development challenge in the future. The impacts of
             climate change on fisheries and aquaculture production throughout the region are also
             expected to be significant (FAO, 2011a).

             SUMMARY RESULTS OF THE REVIEW
             The Paris Agreement between 196 Parties to the United Nations Framework
             Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will act to limit the increase in global
             average temperature to below 2° C. This is a long-term commitment to balance
             emission sources and sinks from 2020 to 2025 and beyond. Implementation will be
             through INDC. Although the format and specific content of the initial INDC were
             left largely to countries to decide, these documents generally included priority areas
             for adaptation and climate resilience, policies or mechanisms to meet the mitigation and
             adaptation contributions, implementation requirements covering financial assistance,
             technology transfer and capacity-building.
                 A review of the INDC from Asia and the Pacific region and associated priority
             actions by sector reveals that agriculture (comprising crops, livestock, forestry,
             fisheries and aquaculture) is a key concern for countries in the region (Damen, 2017)
             and as many as 256 actions can be identified from INDC submitted by parties in the
             region (Figure 2).
                 Looking specifically at the fisheries sector, 12 priority actions were identified in
             INDC from eight countries in the region, the majority of which focused on adaptation
             in the fisheries sector more specifically (Figure 3). Proposed actions include employing
             stress-tolerant fish varieties, enhancing resilience to marine disasters, strengthening
             insurance schemes for fisherfolk and promoting adaptive aquaculture practices.
                 Other existing national planning processes to tackle climate change include
             National Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPA), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)
             and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA), and are key pillars of
             INDC preparation and implementation. An assessment of how the fisheries and
             aquaculture sector were integrated into these instruments, particularly the NAPA,

provides some indication of potential future challenges that lie ahead for these sectors
and their integration into INDC planning and implementation. This analysis showed
that despite the importance and vulnerability of the sector to climate change impacts in
many countries, they were not well represented in these national plans (FAO, 2011b)
(Figure 4). In addition, potential (negative) secondary impacts of many actions on
the fisheries and aquaculture sector in the proposed NAPA were not fully identified
(such as watershed management for irrigation, flood protection, mangrove replanting).
Similarly, regional fisheries issues such as transboundary management of shared stocks
were not considered.
   Within the Asia-Pacific region, a range of actions are underway or planned by
FAO and regional fisheries bodies including the Asia-Pacific Fisheries Commission
(APFIC), the Southeast Asia Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC) and the
Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia (NACA).
   FAO and APFIC have supported analyses of climate change related sector needs by
countries in the past (FAO, 2011a) and a number of projects are underway to address
these issues. Climate change has been identified as a major regional area of work for

             FAO. FAO is working with partners such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
             projects in the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and the Republic of Bangladesh,
             with more planned activities for the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste, the Kingdom
             of Cambodia and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Broadly, these projects support
             capacity development, technical advice for policy and institutional development.
             Within the context of an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) and
             an Ecosystem Approach to Aquaculture (EAA), climate change adaptation planning
             and implementation actions and monitoring at community and national level are being
             undertaken. FAO is also integrating climate change actions into regional programmes,
             such as the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem programme (BOBLME).
                 SEAFDEC has 11 member countries, namely Brunei Darussalam, the Kingdom
             of Cambodia, the Republic of Indonesia, Japan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic
             (PDR), Malaysia, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the Republic of Philippines,
             the Republic of Singapore, the Kingdom of Thailand, and the Socialist Republic of Viet
             Nam. It has a mandate to “develop and manage the fisheries potential of the region by
             rational utilization of the resources for providing food security and safety to the people
             and alleviating poverty through transfer of new technologies, research and information
             dissemination activities.” As part of delivering this mandate, climate change resilience
             is addressed through integration into the SEAFDEC Program Framework. SEAFDEC
             have been carrying out a range of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities
             to support member countries. In particular, a project on “Optimizing energy use in
             fisheries in Southeast Asia” is ongoing.
                 The Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific (NACA) is an
             intergovernmental organization with 19 member governments, namely Australia,
             the Republic of Bangladesh, the Kingdom of Cambodia, the People’s Republic of
             China, Hong Kong SAR (of China), the Republic of India, the Republic of Indonesia,
             Islamic Republic of Iran, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Lao People’s
             Democratic Republic (PDR), Malaysia, the Republic of Maldives, the Republic of the
             Union of Myanmar, the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, the Islamic Republic
             of Pakistan, the Republic of Philippines, the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri
             Lanka, the Kingdom of Thailand and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Its mandate
             is to promote rural development through sustainable aquaculture and aquatic resource
             management and seeks to improve the livelihoods of rural people, reduce poverty and
             increase food security. The work programme structure of NACA includes thematic

areas on aquatic animal health, sustainable farming systems, food safety, quality and
certification, genetics and biodiversity and emerging global issues including responses
to climate change. Three additional cross-cutting programmes facilitate and support
implementation of the thematic work programmes, namely Education and Training,
Gender, and Information and Communications.
   In the past NACA has implemented specific projects related to climate, including
one on strengthening adaptive capacities to the impacts of climate change (Aquaclimate
Project). There has also been a workshop titled “Developing an environmental
monitoring system to strengthen fisheries and aquaculture resilience and improve early
warning in the Lower Mekong Basin” (Virapat et al., eds., 2017). Some of NACA’s
current activities and future work related to climate change adaptation and mitigation
include:
   • culture-based fisheries development in the Kingdom of Cambodia;
   • adaptive learning in sustainable aquaculture (Best Practices for Small-Scale
      Shrimp Farmers in the Kingdom of Thailand);
   • organization of the global conference on climate change adaptation within
      fisheries and aquaculture (FishAdapt);
   • cooperation with the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem programme
      (BOBLME);
   • strategic network programme to promote smallholder farmers in aquaculture
      genetic improvement (National Broodstock Improvement Network);
   • the installation of a monitoring and early warning system relevant to fisheries and
      aquaculture in the Lower Mekong Basin;
   • regional training programme in aquaculture governance in the Asia-Pacific region;
   • women, youth and aquaculture development programmes relevant to climate
      change adaptation and mitigation; and
   • planting mangroves for integrated multiple benefits – a new paradigm.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Climate change agreements are facilitating incremental progress toward global action
on climate change with a move from differentiated to shared responsibilities. The role
of agriculture, including fisheries and aquaculture, has been increasingly acknowledged
in climate change agreements. The Paris Agreement is an important milestone that
elevates the role that agriculture has in tackling climate challenges. The INDC provide
a framework for action, which a number of countries in the region have used to
identify specific actions for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors.
   Enhanced engagement in INDC review and planning up to 2020 will be important
to ensure the fisheries and aquaculture sectors’ priorities are properly reflected.
NAPA and other climate change planning processes are key pillars for planning and
implementing INDC actions. Sub-sector engagement will be crucial for ensuring
adaptation requirements are fully integrated.
   In order for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors to contribute fully to INDC it
is essential that they are able to participate fully in national planning processes. To
do so they should strengthen coordination mechanisms to ensure participation of the
sector in national planning to include and align with other national policies. Adoption
of integrated/cross-sectoral approaches such as EAFM and EAA can help along with
consideration of transboundary issues and management of shared stocks.

Glossary

Definitions retrieved from the IPCC AR5 glossary (IPCC. 2014. Climate change
2014: Impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, Working Group II. http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/)


Adaptation – the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects.
In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial
opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment
to expected climate change and its effects.

Adaptive capacity – the ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms
to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to
consequences.

Adaptive management – A process of iteratively planning, implementing and
modifying strategies for managing resources in the face of uncertainty and change.
Adaptive management involves adjusting approaches in response to observations of
their effect and changes in the system brought on by resulting feedback effects and
other variables.

Autonomous adaptation – Adaptation in response to experienced climate and its
effects, without planning explicitly or consciously focused on addressing climate
change. Also referred to as spontaneous adaptation.

Biomass – The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume; dead plant
material can be included as dead biomass.

Capacity building – The practice of enhancing the strengths and attributes of, and
resources available to, an individual, community, society or organization to respond
to change.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) – A naturally occurring gas, also a by-product of burning
fossil fuels from fossil carbon deposits, such as oil, gas and coal, of burning biomass,
of land use changes, and of industrial processes (e.g. cement production). It is the
principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas that affects the Earth’s radiative balance. It is
the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are measured and therefore has
a Global Warming Potential of 1.

Climate change – Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can
be identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability
of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.
Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcing such
as modulations of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic
changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.
210 Proceedings of FishAdapt: the Global Conference on Climate Change Adaptation for Fisheries and Aquaculture




             Climate variability – Climate variability refers to variations in the mean state and
             other statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes, etc.) of the
             climate on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events.
             Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal
             variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external
             variability). See also Climate change.

             Climatic driver (Climate driver) – A changing aspect of the climate system that
             influences a component of a human or natural system.

             Community-based adaptation – Local, community-driven adaptation. Community-
             based adaptation focuses attention on empowering and promoting the adaptive
             capacity of communities. It is an approach that takes context, culture, knowledge,
             agency and preferences of communities as strengths.

             Contextual vulnerability (Starting-point vulnerability) – A present inability to cope
             with external pressures or changes, such as changing climate conditions. Contextual
             vulnerability is a characteristic of social and ecological systems generated by multiple
             factors and processes.

             Convection – Vertical motion driven by buoyancy forces arising from static instability,
             usually caused by near-surface cooling or increases in salinity in the case of the ocean
             and near-surface warming or cloud-top radiative cooling in the case of the atmosphere.
             In the atmosphere, convection gives rise to cumulus clouds and precipitation and is
             effective at both scavenging and vertically transporting chemical species. In the ocean,
             convection can carry surface waters to deep within the ocean.

             Coral bleaching – Loss of coral pigmentation through the loss of intracellular
             symbiotic algae (known as zooxanthellae) and/or loss of their pigments.

             Dead zones – Extremely hypoxic (i.e. low-oxygen) areas in oceans and lakes, caused by
             excessive nutrient input from human activities coupled with other factors that deplete
             the oxygen required to support many marine organisms in bottom and near-bottom
             water.

             Disaster management – Social processes for designing, implementing, and evaluating
             strategies, policies, and measures that promote and improve disaster preparedness,
             response, and recovery practices at different organizational and societal levels.

             Ecosystem approach – A strategy for the integrated management of land, water, and
             living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way.
             An ecosystem approach is based on the application of scientific methodologies focused
             on levels of biological organization, which encompass the essential structure, processes,
             functions, and interactions of organisms and their environment. It recognizes that
             humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems.
             The ecosystem approach requires adaptive management to deal with the complex and
             dynamic nature of ecosystems and the absence of complete knowledge or understanding
             of their functioning. Priority targets are conservation of biodiversity and of the
             ecosystem structure and functioning, in order to maintain ecosystem services.
Glossary                                                                                       211




Ecosystem-based adaptation – The use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part
of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to the adverse effects of climate
change. Ecosystem-based adaptation uses the range of opportunities for the sustainable
management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems to provide services that enable
people to adapt to the impacts of climate change. It aims to maintain and increase the
resilience and reduce the vulnerability of ecosystems and people in the face of the
adverse effects of climate change. Ecosystem-based adaptation is most appropriately
integrated into broader adaptation and development strategies.

El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – The term El Niño was initially used to
describe a warm-water current that periodically flows along the coast of Ecuador
and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has since become identified with a basin-
wide warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean east of the dateline. This oceanic event
is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface
pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere-ocean
phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the
El Niño-Southern Oscillation. It is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly
difference between Tahiti and Darwin or the sea surface temperatures in the central and
eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade winds weaken,
reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such that the sea surface temperatures
warm, further weakening the trade winds. This event has a great impact on the wind,
sea surface temperature, and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has climatic
effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts of the world, through
global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO is called La Niña.

Eutrophication – Over-enrichment of water by nutrients such as nitrogen and
phosphorus. It is one of the leading causes of water quality impairment. The two most
acute symptoms of eutrophication are hypoxia (or oxygen depletion) and harmful algal
blooms. See also Dead zones.

Extreme weather event – An extreme weather event is an event that is rare at a
particular place and time of year. Definitions of rare vary, but an extreme weather event
would normally be as rare as, or rarer than, the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability
density function estimated from observations. By definition, the characteristics of what
is called extreme weather may vary from place to place in an absolute sense. When a
pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classed as
an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme
(e.g. drought or heavy rainfall over a season).

Food security – A state that prevails when people have secure access to sufficient
amounts of safe and nutritious food for normal growth, development, and an active
and healthy life.

Flood – The overflowing of the normal confines of a stream or other body of water,
or the accumulation of water over areas not normally submerged. Floods include river
(fluvial) floods, flash floods, urban floods, pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods,
and glacial lake outburst floods.

             Greenhouse gas (GHG) – Greenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the
             atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific
             wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface,
             the atmosphere itself, and clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water
             vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and
             ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover,
             there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such
             as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with
             under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O, and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals
             with the greenhouse gases sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and
             perfluorocarbons (PFCs).

             Hypoxic events – Events that lead to deficiencies of oxygen in water bodies. See also
             Dead zones and Eutrophication.

             Ocean acidification – Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the
             ocean over an extended period, typically decades or longer, which is caused primarily
             by uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but can also be caused by other
             chemical additions or subtractions from the ocean.

             Outcome vulnerability (End-point vulnerability) – Vulnerability as the end point of
             a sequence of analyses beginning with projections of future emission trends, moving
             on to the development of climate scenarios, and concluding with biophysical impact
             studies and the identification of adaptive options. Any residual consequences that
             remain after adaptation has taken place define the levels of vulnerability.

             Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) – The midwater layer (200 to 1000 m) in the open
             ocean in which oxygen saturation is the lowest in the ocean. The degree of oxygen
             depletion depends on the largely bacterial consumption of organic matter, and the
             distribution of the OMZs is influenced by large-scale ocean circulation. In coastal
             oceans, OMZs extend to the shelves and may also affect benthic ecosystems.

             Resilience – The capacity of social, economic, and environmental systems to cope with
             a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that
             maintain their essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the
             capacity for adaptation, learning, and transformation

             Risk – The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where
             the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often represented
             as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts
             if these events or trends occur. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability,
             exposure, and hazard.

             Salt-water intrusion/encroachment – Displacement of fresh surface water or
             groundwater by the advance of salt water due to its greater density. This usually occurs
             in coastal and estuarine areas due to decreasing land-based influence (e.g. from reduced
             runoff or groundwater recharge, or from excessive water withdrawals from aquifers) or
             increasing marine influence (e.g. relative sea level rise).
Glossary                                                                                      213




Sea level change – Sea level can change, both globally and locally due to (1) changes
in the shape of the ocean basins; (2) a change in ocean volume as a result of a change in
the mass of water in the ocean; and (3) changes in ocean volume as a result of changes
in ocean water density. Global mean sea level change resulting from change in the
mass of the ocean is called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level change due
to the addition or removal of a mass of water is called its sea level equivalent. Sea level
changes, both globally and locally, resulting from changes in water density are called
steric. Density changes induced by temperature changes only are called thermosteric,
while density changes induced by salinity changes are called halosteric. Barystatic and
steric sea level changes do not include the effect of changes in the shape of ocean basins
induced by the change in the ocean mass and its distribution.

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) – The sea surface temperature is the subsurface bulk
temperature in the top few meters of the ocean, measured by ships, buoys, and drifters.
From ships, measurements of water samples in buckets were mostly switched in the
1940s to samples from engine intake water. Satellite measurements of skin temperature
(uppermost layer; a fraction of a millimeter thick) in the infrared or the top centimeter
or so in the microwave are also used, but must be adjusted to be compatible with the
bulk temperature.

Sensitivity – The degree to which a system or species is affected, either adversely or
beneficially, by climate variability or change. The effect may be direct (e.g. a change in
crop yield in response to a change in the mean, range or variability of temperature) or
indirect (e.g. damages caused by an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due
to sea level rise).

Storm surge – The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea
due to extreme meteorological conditions (low atmospheric pressure and/or strong
winds). The storm surge is defined as being the excess above the level expected from
the tidal variation alone at that time and place.

Thermal expansion – In connection with sea level, this refers to the increase in volume
(and decrease in density) that results from warming water. A warming of the ocean
leads to an expansion of the ocean volume and hence an increase in sea level.

Thermocline – The layer of maximum vertical temperature gradient in the ocean, lying
between the surface ocean and the abyssal ocean. In subtropical regions, its source
waters are typically surface waters at higher latitudes that have subducted and moved
equatorward. At high latitudes, it is sometimes absent, replaced by a halocline, which
is a layer of maximum vertical salinity gradient.

Upwelling region – A region of an ocean where cold, typically nutrient-rich waters
well up from the deep ocean.

Vulnerability – The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability
encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility
to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.

Proceedings of FishAdapt:
the Global Conference on
Climate Change Adaptation for
Fisheries and Aquaculture
8–10 August 2016
Bangkok, Thailand

Climate variability and change are aﬀecting hydro-meteorological
cycles and altering aquatic ecosystems, driving shifts in physical and
chemical processes, ecological communities and the distribution and
abundance of species. These changes have implications for ﬁsheries
management, food security and the livelihoods of more than
600 million people worldwide that are employed in ﬁsheries and
aquaculture, their value chains and related industries.

This conference, FishAdapt: the global conference on climate change
adaptation for ﬁsheries and aquaculture, held in Bangkok from 8 to 10
August, 2016, provided a forum for scientists, development
professionals and natural resource managers working in the context of
ﬁsheries, aquaculture, rural development and related ﬁelds to share
practical experiences in understanding the vulnerabilities associated
with climate change and ocean acidiﬁcation and the development of
risk management and adaptation strategies. The conference bridged
interdisciplinary gaps and provide a wider, shared perspective on the
issues and the current state of knowledge. These proceedings share
the experiences of the 110 participants from 27 countries and show
that much can be done at the household, community and sector levels
to support the resilience of the sector and its dependent communities
in a changing climate.
