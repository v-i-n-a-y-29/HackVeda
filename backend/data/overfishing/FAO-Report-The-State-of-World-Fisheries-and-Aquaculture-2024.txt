METHODOLOGY


The preparation and production of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2024 is a 15-month process
which started in April 2023. The work was guided and supervised by an editorial board, chaired by
the FAO Assistant Director-General and Director of the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Division (NFI),
representing all the teams of the division, and steered by a core executive group of the NFI Information
and Knowledge Management Team and a representative of the FAO Office of Communications.

The editorial board met regularly to design, develop and refine the structure and content of the report,
then to review progress and address emerging issues brought by the core executive group. Based on the
agreed structure, different senior editorial board members were assigned the leadership of a thematic
section. Most contributions were prepared by FAO authors, including from FAO Decentralized Offices,
in collaboration with external experts where appropriate (see Acknowledgements, p. xii). The work
of the editorial board benefited from wider consultation among the FAO teams in charge of the FAO
flagship publications.

Between April and June 2023, thematic section leaders coordinated proposals for a wide range of
topics from the officers in the division, in consultation with officers from other FAO divisions and FAO
Decentralized Offices. The proposals were reviewed by the editorial board to refine the outline ensuring
it addressed current and emerging issues. The working outline took into consideration how ongoing
FAO undertakings reflect Blue Transformation in action and align with the outcomes of high-level global
and regional events and initiatives as well as concrete achievements on policies, norms and standards,
technical innovation, partnerships and results at regional and country levels.

The longstanding Part 1 on world review, status and trends has benefited from improved data collection
methodology, tools and analyses and has been extended to cover the regular monitoring of the SDG 14
indicators under FAO custodianship. Part 2 sets the scene for reporting and demonstrating Blue
Transformation in action in global and regional fora, but also on the ground. Part 3 addresses outlook and
contemporary issues, complementing the other two parts to inform stakeholders and to provide guidance
to policy- and decision-makers in charge of fisheries and aquaculture. Following on from the 2022 edition,
this report includes an executive summary, which covers the entire publication, and an expanded glossary.
For the first time, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture features infographics to illustrate the key
messages and executive summary.

In June 2023, a summary was prepared for each section and subsection, with inputs from section leaders,
and revised based on feedback from the editorial board. The summary document was submitted to NFI
management, then to the FAO Deputy Director-General for approval in July 2023. This document formed
the blueprint guiding authors in the drafting of the publication.

Part 2 and most of Part 3 were drafted and edited for technical and language content between August
2023 and November 2023. Part 1 and the section on projections in Part 3 were drafted and edited between
1 January and 1 April 2024, because they are based on FAO’s official fisheries and aquaculture statistics,
which only become available upon annual closure of the thematic databases in which the data are
structured. The process requires careful collation, cross checking, revision and validation. In the absence
of national reporting, FAO makes estimates based on the best data available from other authoritative
sources or through standard methodologies.


                                                     |x|
All parts were reviewed by a subgroup of the editorial board including managers of the FAO Fisheries and
Aquaculture Division. In addition, Parts 2 and 3 (except projections) were submitted in December 2023 to
a panel of three external experts covering respectively aquaculture, capture fisheries and value chains for
their review and recommendations (see Acknowledgements, p. xii).

Based on an agreed schedule, the finalized English drafts of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture
2024 were submitted in batches to the Language Branch for translation into FAO’s other five official
languages and to the Publications and Library Branch for copyediting, layout and processing.

Recent developments in fisheries and aquaculture have been accompanied by a major expansion of the
associated terminology necessitating its thorough review to ensure coherence throughout the report.
The glossary prepared in 2022 has been expanded for this edition, using definitions provided by
authoritative sources of FAO or others. A Glossary Working Group was set up to complete this task and
assist authors.

A final draft of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2024 was submitted to the Office of the FAO
Deputy Director-General and to the Office of the FAO Director-General for approval.

      World fisheries and aquaculture production hit a                        Aquaculture can meet the rising global demand
      new high in 2022. Successful initiatives should be                      for aquatic foods. Future expansion must
      upscaled to consolidate the vital role of aquatic                       prioritize sustainability and benefit regions and
foods for global food security, nutrition and livelihoods.                communities most in need.

 Global fisheries and aquaculture production surged                       In 2022, global aquaculture production
  to 223.2 million tonnes, with 185.4 million tonnes of                     reached 130.9 million tonnes, valued at
  aquatic animals and 37.8 million tonnes of algae.                         USD 312.8 billion, 59 percent of global fisheries
 Of the total aquatic animal production, 89 percent                        and aquaculture production.
  was used for human consumption, equivalent to an                         Inland aquaculture contributed 62.6 percent of farmed
  estimated 20.7 kg per capita in 2022. The rest went on                    aquatic animals, marine and coastal aquaculture
  non-food uses, mostly fishmeal and fish oil.                              37.4 percent.
 An estimated 61.8 million people were employed in                        For the first time, aquaculture surpassed capture
  the primary production sector, mostly in small-scale                      fisheries in aquatic animal production with 94.4 million
  operations. Sex-disaggregated data indicate that                          tonnes, representing 51 percent of the world total and
  24 percent of fishers and fish farmers were women                         a record 57 percent of the production destined for
  compared with 62 percent in the post-harvest sector.                      human consumption.
 Over 230 countries and territories were involved in                      Aquaculture remains dominated by a small number
  the international trade of aquatic products, reaching a                   of countries, with many low-income countries in
  record value of USD 195 billion – a 19 percent increase                   Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean not
  from pre-pandemic levels in 2019.                                         exploiting their full potential.
 In low- and middle-income countries, the total net trade                 Out of some 730 farmed species items, 17 staple
  (exports minus imports) of aquatic animal products                        species represent about 60 percent of global
  reached USD 45 billion – greater than that of all other                   aquaculture production, while other species are
  agricultural products combined.                                           important at local level.
 Further transformative and adaptive actions are needed                   Targeted policies, technology transfer, capacity
  to strengthen the resilience of aquatic food systems and                  building and responsible investment are crucial to boost
  consolidate their role in addressing hunger, malnutrition                 sustainable aquaculture where it is most needed, in
  and poverty.                                                              particular in Africa.

      Global capture fisheries production remains                       Aquatic animal foods provide high-quality proteins –
      stable, but sustainability of fishery resources is                 15 percent of animal proteins and 6 percent of total

the QA level passed.
* For countries passing only QA1, an indicator can be calculated when a stock status is provided for at least one stock of the country reference list;
indicators calculated for these countries are reported with low reliability. If less than five stocks are presented with status not covering the required
portion of the landings, a low reliability index will however not be reported.

     Integrating aquaculture with agriculture in
arid environments produces more benefits than
conventional agriculture. This includes significantly
reducing, and in some cases eliminating, the need
for fertilizers. Crops benefit from the nutrients
in fish farm water, and the same volume of farm
water results in increased yields. In Egypt, Nile
tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) accounts for
90 percent of desert-based aquaculture production.
Farms use underground saline water reserves,
desalination plants and/or agricultural drainage.
Water varies in salinity between 0.5 g and 26 g
per litre and in temperature between 22 °C and
26 °C. European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax)
and gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) are other
fish species suitable for farming in high salinity
areas. Most commercial fish farms have adopted
flow-through systems to irrigate agricultural land,
enabling production of vegetables, fruits and arable
crops, as well as clovers for feeding livestock.

SUMMARY OF SELECT DATABASES CONTAINING NUTRIENT COMPOSITION DATA ON AQUATIC FOODS



SERVING UP DATA ON NUTRIENT COMPOSITION OF AQUATIC FOODS
The nutrient values of fish and other aquatic foods can alleviate “hidden hunger” or micronutrient deficiencies for many
people in a range of geographies. But nutrient measures for many species, food types and geographies are unavailable, and
are prohibitively expensive to determine. Therefore, databases that house the data that do exist are incredibly valuable for
health practitioners, fisheries managers, researchers and policymakers. There are many databases out there – each useful,
overlapping and distinct in different ways. Here is a summary of these powerful databases, with the users they best serve,
the types of data they hold and how they compare.

NOTES: Considering 100 kg of fish: a) food loss and waste (FLW) is 30 kg and only 23 kg are consumed as food, with the volume of by-products
representing 47 kg; b) eliminating FLW would increase fish for consumption from 23 kg to 33 kg (an increase of about 40 percent); c) converting all
by-products into food would increase fish for consumption from 23 kg to 70 kg (an increase of about 200 percent).

    NOTES: Risk (blue bars) is the product of the hazard (H) (an event’s potential to cause negative repercussions, computed here as the compound
    probability that a major El Niño event occurs and that it has a significant physical manifestation in the sea surface temperature); exposure (E) is the
    number of fisheries at risk (the proportion of fisheries with significant catch reduction during an event); vulnerability (V) is the severity of the impact on
    the fisheries at risk (estimated as the average catch reduction in the significantly affected fisheries). Areas with no risk graph correspond to those where
    no significant physical presence of El Niño was detected.

The 2024 edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture features the Blue
Transformation in action, illustrated by activities and initiatives, led by FAO in collaboration
with Members, partners and key stakeholders, to integrate aquatic foods into global food
security and sustainability, enhance policy advocacy, scientific research and capacity
building, disseminate sustainable practices and technological innovations, and support
community involvement.



Part 1 of this edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture benefits from
significant improvements in data collection, analytical and assessment tools and
methodologies to present the most up-to-date review of world fisheries and aquaculture
production and utilization. Part 2 highlights the role of FAO and its partners to catalyse the
transformational changes required to support aquaculture expansion and intensification,
effective management of global fisheries and upgrading of aquatic value chains. Part 3
covers the high-impact challenges and opportunities of the untapped potential of utilizing
whole fish and by-products to improve food security and nutrition, expounds on the role of
aquatic food systems in providing critical climate, biodiversity and environmentally sound
solutions, and highlights the importance of their integration into national and multilateral
processes. It also presents an outlook on future trends up to 2032 based on projections.



The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2024 provides the most up-to-date and
evidence-based information, supporting policy, scientific and technical insights on
challenges, opportunities and innovations shaping the present and future of the sector, for
the benefit of a wide and expanding audience of policymakers, managers, scientists,
fishers, farmers, traders, civil society activists and consumers.
