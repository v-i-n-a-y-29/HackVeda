disease challenges are tackled successfully; and
to maintain complete and accurate national
statistics in support of policy development and
implementation. These and other challenges
engendered FAO’s Blue Growth Initiative, an
innovative, integrated and multisectoral approach
to the management of aquatic resources aimed at
maximizing the ecosystem goods and ser vices
obtained from the use of oceans, inland waters
and wetlands, while also providing social and
economic benefits.

METHODOLOGY

The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2018 is the product of an 18-month process, initiated in
Januar y 2017. An editorial board comprising staff of the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department and
a representative of the Office of Corporate Communication, and chaired by the Director of the FAO
Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy and Resources Division, met at reg ular inter vals to plan the content and
structure, refine terminolog y and review progress.

The structure was planned to follow that of previous editions for the most part, with some modifications:
Part 2 (previously “Selected issues”) would emphasize FAO’s work and position in key thematic areas;
Part 3 (previously “Highlights of special studies”) would be renamed to focus on ongoing work in
partnership; and Part 4 would address not only projections (outlook), but also emerging issues. The world
review in Part 1 would follow the format and process of past years.

In April 2017, Fisheries and Aquaculture Department staff were invited to identif y suitable topics and
contributors for Parts 2, 3 and 4, and the editorial board compiled and refined the outline. Ultimately, the
process from planning through review involved virtually all officers in the department, both headquarters
and decentralized staff. Some 75 FAO authors contributed (many to multiple sections), as well as several
authors external to FAO (see Acknowledgements).

In summer 2017, a summar y of Parts 2 to 4 was prepared with the inputs of all lead authors and revised
based on feedback from the editorial board. The summar y document was submitted to Fisheries and
Aquaculture Department management and the FAO Deput y-Director-General, Climate and Natural
Resources, for approval in early September 2017. This document formed the blueprint g uiding authors in
the drafting of the publication.

Parts 2 to 4 were drafted between September and December 2017, edited for lang uage and technical
content, and sent in Januar y 2018 for review by FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department management,
by three external experts in the areas of capture fisheries, aquaculture and trade and market access, and
by the editorial board.

The world review in Part 1 is based on FAO’s official fisher y and aquaculture statistics. To ref lect the
most up-to-date statistics available, this part was drafted in March 2018 upon annual closure of the
various thematic databases in which the data are structured (see Over view in Part 1 for details). The
statistics are the outcome of an established mechanism to ensure the best possible information, including
assistance to enhance countries’ capacit y to collect and submit data according to international standards
and a careful process of collation, revision and validation. In the absence of national reporting, FAO may
make estimates based on the best data available from other sources or through standard methodologies.

The draft was sent for comments to other FAO departments and regional offices, and a final draft was
submitted to the Office of the FAO Deput y Director General – Climate and Natural Resources and the
Office of the FAO Director-General for approval.

2016–2017 MARGARITA LIZÁRRAGA MEDAL

The FAO Margarita Lizárraga Medal is awarded every
two years to a person or organization that has served
with distinction in the promotion and application of the
Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. In 2016–
2017, the award was given to the Commission for the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(CCAMLR) in recognition of its outstanding, practical,
tangible, sustainable and catalytic contribution to the
conservation and management of marine living
resources in the convention area (the Southern Ocean).




                                                                                                                                                          ©FAO/Carlo Perla
In particular, CCAMLR was recognized for its
precautionary and ecosystem-based approach to
balancing environmental conservation with the rational
utilization of resources. This achievement is considered

                The 2018 edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture emphasizes the sector’s role in
                achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals,
                and measurement of progress towards these goals. It notes the particular contributions of inland and
                small-scale fisheries, and highlights the importance of rights-based governance for equitable and
                inclusive development.

                As in past editions, the publication begins with a global analysis of trends in fisheries and
                aquaculture production, stocks, processing and use, trade and consumption, based on the latest
                official statistics, along with a review of the status of the world’s fishing fleets and human
                engagement and governance in the sector. Topics explored in Parts 2 to 4 include aquatic
                biodiversity; the ecosystem approach to fisheries and to aquaculture; climate change impacts and
                responses; the sector’s contribution to food security and human nutrition; and issues related to
                international trade, consumer protection and sustainable value chains. Global developments in
                combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, selected ocean pollution concerns and FAO’s
                efforts to improve capture fishery data are also discussed. The issue concludes with the outlook for
                the sector, including projections to 2030.

                As always, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture aims to provide objective, reliable and
                up-to-date information to a wide audience, including policy-makers, managers, scientists,
                stakeholders and indeed all those interested in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.
